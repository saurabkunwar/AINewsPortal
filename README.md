# AINewsPortal

This is a news summarization Django app powered by Pegasus Model. This app scraps news from news website like KathmanduPost and NepalNews and summarizes it in a proper way so that user can save their time when browsing news.

Beside summarization, it also utilizes power of Semantic Textual Similarity to suggest similar news.

It is an ongoing project. Upcoming feature includes, tracking user behavior for proper news suggestion and I'm planning to include question answering system from news articles.


## Motivation

Reading news is a very time consuming process. Most news have filler content that might not be important for the viewers. And the news are cluttered with unwanted ads. Beside that, we can hardly get related news article.

Through this project, I aim to summarize these news in a very short format and use semantic similarity to suggest similar news article.
