820,UN oceans conference eyes steps toward high seas agreement,"The United Nations is hoping an international conference that got underway Monday will bring fresh momentum to protracted efforts for a global agreement on protecting the world’s oceans.
The five-day U.N. Ocean Conference in Lisbon, Portugal has drawn senior officials and scientists from more than 120 countries to the Atlantic port city in Southwest Europe, as well as activists dismayed by the failure to come up with international rules that might ensure ocean sustainability.

In his opening remarks at the conference, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries to show “unity and togetherness around the issues of the sea.”
“Sadly, we have taken the ocean for granted, and today we face what I would call an ocean emergency,” Guterres said. “We must turn the tide.”","The five-day U.N.

812,Water crisis in Pakistan impacts food security," The ongoing water crisis in Pakistan has badly impacted the agriculture sector and agri-driven export industry as the situation is leading to severe drought in several areas of the country.
Despite the grave situation, not much attention is being given by the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government.
""There has not been sufficient focus on tackling the water crisis by investing in water governance, safeguarding water resources or building small and localized dams for water conservation,"" said Arif Jabbar Khan, country director for Water Aid Pakistan as quoted by Daily Times.
""Institutional confusion over responsibilities for the provision of water and water management has been another important problem at the national and provincial level,"" he said.
Notably, the crisis not only impacts Pakistan's agriculture sector, which contributes to 23 per cent of the nation's GDP, according to the media outlet, but is also an existential threat to energy and food security, and therefore national security.
Pakistan is facing an extraordinary water shortage of around 50 per cent, the highest ever since 1991, according to the media reports.
The water shortage in Sindh has been a great issue. Not only Sindh province but also Punjab province is facing up to 75 per cent water shortage.
According to the data shared by the Punjab Irrigation Department, the Taunsa Barrage supplied only 6,700 cusecs. It is 73 per cent less than its requirement of 25,000 cusecs. Moreover, the Thal Canal was facing 75 per cent scarcity as 2,000 cusecs of water were released into it against the need of 8,000 cusecs.
The Panjnad Barrage was also running with a 66 per cent shortage, receiving 4,300 cusecs against the requirement of 12,700 cusecs. Rasul Barrage was suffering 59 per cent water stress with a supply of 9,900 cusecs against the need of 24,200 cusecs.
Both Sulemanki Barrage and Lower Bahawal Canal were facing 54 per cent shortage each, Sidhnai Barrage 51 per cent, Islam Barrage 50 per cent and Trimmu Barrage 43 per cent water scarcity. There was a 33 per cent water shortage in the Mailsi canal.
Experts have been warning for months that 26 per cent less snowfall than last year in winter, followed by negligible rainfall in March and April, meant very serious water problems this year, yet it raised no red flags in Islamabad.",Pakistan is facing an extraordinary water shortage of around 50 per cent .The water shortage in Sindh has been a great issue .Not only Sindh but also Punjab province is facing up to 75 per cent water shortage .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/global/water-crisis-in-pakistan-impacts-food-security,Nepal News,global,6/27/2022 17:54

""We remain appalled by and continue to condemn the brutal, unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia and aided by Belarus.

This devastating war has produced dramatic consequences far beyond Europe,"" the leaders said in a joint statement.

The leaders also pledged USD 29.5 billion to help ensure the delivery of basic services to the Ukrainian people.
""As of today we are ready to grant, or have pledged and provided up to USD 29.5 billion of budget support in 2022 to help Ukraine close its financing gap and continue ensuring the delivery of basic services to the Ukrainian people,"" the statement read.

806,Stars use BET Awards stage to criticize Roe v. Wade ruling,"Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae and Jazmine Sullivan were some of the big stars using the BET Awards stage to strongly criticize the Supreme Court’s recent decision to strip away women’s constitutional protection for abortion.
Henson took the stage as the show’s host on Sunday with an uplifting message about “Black excellence” before she launched into the court’s overturning of the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling last week. The actor took the stage after Lizzo opened the show with a flute solo in a glittery-gold outfit performing her single “About Damn Time.”
“It’s about damn time we talk about the fact that guns have more rights than a woman. It’s a sad day in America,” said Henson, thanking Lizzo who along with Live Nation recently donated $1 million in tour proceeds to Planned Parenthood. “A weapon that can take lives has more power than a woman that can give life – if she chooses to.”Janelle Monae held up her middle finger toward the Supreme Court before she introduced nominees for best female R&B/pop artist. Her speech earned standing applause at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.
“These artists are making art on our own terms, owning our truths and expressing ourselves freely and unapologetically in a world that tries to control and police our bodies, my body and our decisions, my body,” said the singer, who also paid homage to the LGBTQ+ community. “(explicit) you Supreme Court. I know we’re celebrating right now as we should. We absolutely deserve to celebrate — especially now we should celebrate our art by protecting our rights and our truths.”Afterwards, Monae introduced Sullivan as the category’s winner — who made a plea to men for their support of women.
“It’s a hard time for us,” Sullivan said. “I want to speak directly to the men: We need y’all. We need y’all to stand up, stand up for us, stand up with us. If you’ve ever benefitted from a woman making one of the toughest decisions of her life, which is to terminate a pregnancy, you need to be standing. This is not just a woman issue. This is everybody’s issue. We need your support more than ever.”
Latto gave an emotional speech after she won best new artist.
“It’s giving pro-choice,” said the rapper, who later performed her smash hit “Big Energy” with Mariah Carey. “It’s never giving a man policing my body.”
Singer Tems dedicated her best international act award to the many women who “dare to dream.”
“Where I’m from, things like this don’t happen,” said the Lagos, Nigeria-born singer who won best collaboration with Justin Bieber and Wizkid for their song “Essence.” “This is a dream. If you’re watching me, I want you to imagine yourself as me because you are meant to be here too.”
Doja Cat entered the show as the leading nominee with six. The chart-topping performer is up for best female R&B-pop artist, best female hip-hop artist, album of the year for her No. 1 hit “Planet Her” and BET Her for “Woman.” Her “Kiss Me More” with SZA is nominated for video of the year and best collaboration.Sean “Diddy” Combs will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award — one of the highest honors at the ceremony. The music mogul is the founder of Bad Boy Records, has his own television network, fashion line and is a three-time Grammy winner who has worked with a slew of top-tier artists including Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and 112.
Drake and Ari Lennox were the second-most nominated acts, scoring four nods each. Three nominations went to several others including Baby Keem, Silk Sonic, Chloe Bailey, Future, H.E.R., Jazmine Sullivan, Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), Kendrick Lamar, Lil Baby, Mary J. Blige and Tems.
Jack Harlow performed “Poison” alongside Lil Wayne before Brandy hit the stage with him for his hit “First Class.” While Harlow and Brandy performed, the camera turned to her brother, Ray J, who was seen dancing in the audience.
Chance the Rapper and Joey Bada$$ performed “The Highs & the Lows.” In her pink gown, Muni Long opened her set with a snippet of “Time Machine” before her jam “Hrs & Hrs.”
The winners in the 19 categories, including film and sports awards, are selected by BET’s Voting Academy, comprised of entertainment professionals and fans.

800,Apple to launch variety of new gadgets starting this fall,"Apple is prepared to introduce a number of new gadgets between this fall and the start of 2023, according to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.
According to The Verge, four iPhone 14 models, a group of new iPads, three Apple Watch models, multiple M2 and M3-updated Macs, updated AirPods Pro earbuds, a new HomePod, and an enhanced Apple TV are among the things Gurman refers to as a ""deluge"" of.
Gurman anticipates finding the chip and its versions in a number of different devices, despite the fact that Apple only revealed two new Macs using its flagship M2 CPU at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this month. An M2 Mac mini, M2 Mac mini Pro, M2 Pro / M2 Max 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros, as well as an M2 Ultra / M2 Extreme Mac Pro, are all included.
There's the long-rumoured mixed reality headgear from Apple, which is anticipated to include an M2 processor. If all of this wasn't overwhelming enough, Gurman claims that Apple's M3 chip is already under development and will probably be used in the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air notebooks that will be available in 2019.
Apple will release the iPhone 14 this autumn, and Gurman's research provides a summary of all the speculations that have been circulating for the previous year or so. One is that, according to reports, the new and more potent A16 chip and support for always-on displays will only be available for the Pro and Pro Max variants.
A 48-megapixel camera sensor, a new notch with a ""pill-shaped cutout"" for Face ID, and a hole-punch-style selfie camera are also expected to be included in the iPhone 14 Pro models. The 6.7-inch variant will replace the Mini model, according to Gurman, while the normal iPhone 14 will contain the A15 CPU found in the iPhone 13.
According to Gurman's source, Apple will introduce 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models using M2 technology later this year, as well as a larger iPad between 14 and 15 inches in the ""next year or two."" Additionally, Gurman supports a previous rumour from 9to5Mac that claims a new entry-level iPad will feature an A14 CPU, 5G, and USB-C connectivity, as reported by The Verge.
The basic Watch Series 8, a redesigned SE, and a more ""rugged"" watch aimed at users who participate in ""extreme sports"" are the other three new Apple Watch models that are anticipated for sale this fall.
Gurman points out that although the S8 chip found in the forthcoming Watch Series 8 will provide performance comparable to that of the S7 and S6 chips, the Watch that will be released the following year is expected to have an updated processor. Gurman predicts that Apple will drop the Series 3 this fall in favour of the new SE, which might include the S8 CPU, an upgrade from the S5 chip found in the SE model from 2020.","Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claims Apple is set to introduce a number of new gadgets between this fall and the start of 2023 .Among them are four iPhone 14 models, a group of new iPads, three Apple Watch models, multiple M2 and M3-updated Macs, updated Pro earbuds, a new AirPods and an enhanced Apple TV .Gurman also claims Apple's M3 chip is already under development and will probably be used in the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air notebooks that will be available in 2019 .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/apple-to-launch-variety-of-new-gadgets-starting-this-fall,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/27/2022 6:58
799,Iran launches rocket into space as nuclear talks to resume,"Iranian state television said Sunday that Tehran had launched a solid-fueled rocket into space, drawing a rebuke from Washington ahead of the expected resumption of stalled talks over Tehran’s tattered nuclear deal with world powers.
It’s unclear when or where the rocket was launched, but the announcement came after satellite photos showed preparations at Imam Khomeini Spaceport in Iran’s rural Semnan province, the site of Iran’s frequent failed attempts to put a satellite into orbit.
State-run media aired dramatic footage of the blastoff against the backdrop of heightened tensions over Tehran’s nuclear program, which is racing ahead under decreasing international oversight.
Iran had previously acknowledged that it planned more tests for the satellite-carrying rocket, which it first launched in February of last year.
Ahmad Hosseini, spokesman for Iran’s Defense Ministry, said Zuljanah, a 25.5 meter-long rocket, was capable of carrying a satellite of 220 kilograms (485 pounds) that would ultimately gather data in low-earth orbit and promote Iran’s space industry. Zuljanah is named for the horse of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.The White House said it was aware of Iran’s announcement and criticized the move as “unhelpful and destabilizing.”The launch comes just a day after the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, travelled to Tehran in a push to resuscitate negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program that have been stalemated for months. A few significant sticking points remain, including Tehran’s demand that Washington lifts terrorism sanctions on its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.
Borrell said on Saturday that talks over the nuclear deal would resume in an unnamed Persian Gulf country in the coming days, with Iranian media reporting that Qatar would likely host the negotiations.
Former President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed crushing sanctions on Iran. Tehran responded by greatly ramping up its nuclear work and now enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.
In a further escalation that limits the international community’s view of its nuclear program, Iran removed over two dozen International Atomic Energy Agency cameras from its nuclear sites this month. The agency’s director called the move a “fatal blow” to the tattered nuclear deal.
Tehran’s rocket launches have raised alarm in Washington amid the unravelling of the nuclear deal. The U.S. warns the launches to defy a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Iran to steer clear of any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
The White House on Sunday said it was committed to using sanctions and other measures to prevent further advances in Iran’s ballistic missile program.
The U.S. intelligence community’s 2022 threat assessment, published in March, claims such a satellite launch vehicle “shortens the timeline” to an intercontinental ballistic missile for Iran as it uses “similar technologies.”Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component.
Even as Iran’s government has sharpened its focus on space, sending several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launching a monkey into space, the program has seen recent troubles. There have been five failed launches in a row for the Simorgh program, a type of satellite-carrying rocket. A fire at the Imam Khomeini Spaceport in February 2019 also killed three researchers.
The launch pad used in the preparations for the launch of the Zuljanah rocket remains scarred from an explosion in August 2019 that even drew the attention of then-President Trump. He later tweeted what appeared to be a classified surveillance image of the launch failure. Satellite images from February suggested a failed Zuljanah launch earlier this year, though Iran did not acknowledge it.
Meanwhile, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in April 2020 revealed its own secret space program by successfully launching a satellite into orbit. The Guard operates its own military infrastructure parallel to Iran’s regular armed forces.

797,Patients of sickle cell anaemia on the rise in Banke,"Patients of sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia are on the rise, especially in the Tharu community in Banke.It was detected during medical screening of sickle cell anaemia along with thalassemia in the areas having the majority of the Tharu population.
According to the District Health Office, Banke, the number of patients diagnosed with sickle cell has reached 23 in Raptisonari rural municipality.
As details of the people examined for sickle cell has yet to be collected from other municipal units, an aggregate number of the survivors has not been ascertained in the district, said Health Office Chief Dhiraj Jung Shah.
Though free treatment has rendered relief to the patients of sickle cell anaemia to some extent, the measure has not relieved the survivors of thalassemia, he further shared.
Even it has not been ascertained how many people are surviving with thalassemia. The screening was carried out among the students of grades 9 and 10 of the Tharu community in Raptisonari. It is still ongoing, he shared.
Some of the patients commented that they have to spend tens of thousands of rupees for treatment in private health institutions after complaining of several physical complications.
The survivors have been facing trouble in their treatment when they were not aware of government-sponsored treatment up to Rs 100,000.
Ram Krishna Tharu, 28, of Raptisonari Rural Municipality-4, Bijapur in Banke said he was not informed of government arrangements for free treatment to the sickle cell anaemia survivors. He added he has spent a huge chunk of money on treatment at private hospitals.
Sickle Cell specialist Dr Rajan Pandey said patients are being compelled to spend tens of thousands of rupees even after their diagnosis. He said the blood test was the permanent solution to sickle cell anaemia.
Apart from Raptisonari rural municipality in the district, Kohalpur municipality also has witnessed the same health issue. Authorities said the overall situation of the district can be ascertained only after collecting data from all local levels.
It was shared that 96 people were diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia when blood samples of 572 people were tested in a screening camp organized by the health office.","The number of patients diagnosed with sickle cell has reached 23 in Raptisonari rural municipality .Though free treatment has rendered relief to the patients of sickle cell anaemia to some extent, the measure has not relieved the survivors of thalassemia .The screening was carried out among the students of grades 9 and 10 of the Tharu community in Raptisonari .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/patients-of-sickle-cell-anaemia-on-the-rise-in-banke,Nepal News,health,6/27/2022 10:57
796,Did corporate greed fuel inflation?,"Furious about surging prices at the gasoline station and the supermarket, many consumers feel they know just where to cast blame: On greedy companies that relentlessly jack up prices and pocket the profits.
Responding to that sentiment, the Democratic-led House of Representatives last month passed on a party-line vote — most Democrats for, all Republicans against — a bill designed to crack down on alleged price gouging by energy producers.
Likewise, Britain last month announced plans to impose a temporary 25% windfall tax on oil and gas company profits and to funnel the proceeds to financially struggling households.
Yet for all the public’s resentment, most economists say corporate price gouging is, at most, one of many causes of runaway inflation — and not the primary one.
“There are much more plausible candidates for what’s going on,” said Jose Azar an economist at Spain’s University of Navarra.They include: Supply disruptions at factories, ports and freight yards. Worker shortages. President Joe Biden’s enormous pandemic aid program. COVID 19-caused shutdowns in China. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And, not least, a Federal Reserve that kept interest rates ultra-low longer than experts say it should have.Most of all, though, economists say resurgent spending by consumers and governments drove inflation up.
The blame game is, if anything, intensifying after the U.S. government reported that inflation hit 8.6% in May from a year earlier, the biggest price spike since 1981.
To fight inflation, the Fed is now belatedly tightening credit aggressively. On June 15, it raised its benchmark short-term rate by three-quarters of a point — its largest hike since 1994 — and signaled that more large rate hikes are coming. The Fed hopes to achieve a notoriously difficult “soft landing” — slowing growth enough to curb inflation without causing the economy to slide into recession.
For years, inflation had remained at or below the Fed’s 2% annual target, even while unemployment sank to a half-century low. But when the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession with startling speed and strength, the U.S. consumer price index rose steadily — from a 2.6% year-over-year increase in March 2021 to last month’s four-decade high.
For a while at least — before profit margins at S&P 500 companies dipped early this year — the inflation surge coincided with swelling corporate earnings. It was easy for consumers to connect the dots: Companies, it seemed, were engaged in price-gouging. This wasn’t just inflation. It was greedflation.
Asked to name the culprits behind the spike in gasoline prices, 72% of the 1,055 Americans polled in late April and early May by the Washington Post and George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government blamed profit-seeking corporations, more than the share who pointed to Russia’s war against Ukraine (69%) or Biden (58%) or pandemic disruptions (58%). And the verdict was bipartisan: 86% of Democrats and 52% of Republicans blamed corporations for inflated gas prices.“It’s very natural for consumers to see prices rising and get angry about it and then look for someone to blame,” said Christopher Conlon, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business who studies corporate competition. “You and I don’t get to set prices at the supermarket, the gas station or the car dealership. So people naturally blame corporations, since those are the ones they see raising prices.’’
Yet Conlon and many other economists are reluctant to indict — or to favor punishing — Corporate America. When the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business asked economists this month whether they’d support a law to bar big companies from selling their goods or services at an “unconscionably excessive price” during a market shock, 65% said no. Only 5% backed the idea.
Just what combination of factors is most responsible for causing prices to soar “is still an open question,” economist Azar acknowledges. COVID-19 and its aftermath have made it hard to assess the state of the economy. Today’s economists have no experience analyzing the financial aftermath of a pandemic.
Policymakers and analysts have been repeatedly blindsided by the path the economy has taken since COVID struck in March 2020: They didn’t expect the swift recovery from the downturn, fueled by vast government spending and record-low rates engineered by the Fed and other central banks. Then they were slow to recognize the gathering threat of high inflation pressures, dismissing them at first as merely a temporary consequence of supply disruptions.One aspect of the economy, though, is undisputed: A wave of mergers in recent decades has killed or shrunk competition among airlines, banks, meatpacking companies and many other industries. That consolidation has given the surviving companies the leverage to demand price cuts from suppliers, to hold down workers’ pay and to pass on higher costs to customers who don’t have much choice but to pay up.
Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston have found that less competition made it easier for companies to pass along higher costs to customers, calling it an “amplifying factor” in the resurgence of inflation.
Josh Bivens, research director at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, has estimated that nearly 54% of the price increases in nonfinancial businesses since mid-2020 can be attributed to “fatter profit margins,” versus just 11% from 1979 through 2019.
Bivens conceded that neither corporate greed nor market clout has likely grown significantly in the past two years. But he suggested that during the COVID inflationary spike, companies have redirected how they use their market power: Many have shifted away from pressuring suppliers to cut costs and limiting workers’ pay and have instead boosted prices for customers.In a study of nearly 3,700 companies released last week, the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute concluded that markups and profit margins last year reached their highest level since the 1950s. It also found that companies that had aggressively raised prices before the pandemic were more likely to do so after it struck, “suggesting a role for market power as an explanatory driver of inflation.″
Yet many economists aren’t convinced that corporate greed is the main culprit. Jason Furman, a top economic adviser in the Obama White House, said that some evidence even suggests that monopolies are slower than companies that face stiff competition to raise prices when their own costs rise, “in part because their prices were high to begin with.”
Likewise, NYU’s Conlon cites examples where prices have soared in competitive markets. Used cars, for example, are sold in lots across the country and by numerous individuals. Yet average used-car prices have skyrocketed 16% over the past year. Similarly, the average price of major appliances, another market with plenty of competitors, jumped nearly 10% last month from a year earlier.By contrast, the price of alcoholic beverages has risen just 4% from a year ago even though the beer market is dominated by AB-Inbev and spirits by Bacardi and Diageo.
“It is hard to imagine that AB-Inbev isn’t as greedy as Maytag,” Conlon said.
So what has most driven the inflationary spike?
“Demand,” said Furman, now at Harvard University. “Lots of government spending, lots of monetary support — all combined together to support extraordinarily high levels of demand. Supply couldn’t keep up, so prices rose.’’
Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimate that government aid to the economy during the pandemic, which put money in consumers’ pockets to help them endure the crisis and set off a spending spree, has raised inflation by about 3 percentage points since the first half of 2021.
In report released in April, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis blamed global supply chain bottlenecks for playing a “significant role” in inflating factory costs. They found that it added a staggering 20 percentage points to wholesale inflation in manufacturing last November, raising it to 30%.
Still, even some economists who don’t blame greedflation for the price spike of the past year say they think governments should try to restrict the market power of monopolies, perhaps by blocking mergers that reduce competition. The idea is that more companies vying for the same customers would encourage innovation and makes the economy more productive.
Even so, tougher antitrust policies wouldn’t likely do much to slow inflation anytime soon.
“I find it helpful to think about competition like diet and exercise,” NYU’s Conlon said. “More competition is a good thing. But, like diet and exercise, the payoffs are long term.
“Right now, the patient is in the emergency room. Sure, diet and exercise are still a good thing. But we need to treat the acute problem of inflation.”

795,Senior US officials visit Sri Lanka to help resolve crisis,"Senior U.S. officials were in Sri Lanka seeking ways to help the island nation cope with an unprecedented economic crisis and severe shortages of essential supplies, as the energy minister warned that new fuel shipments would be delayed.
The U.S. over the past two weeks has announced millions of dollars in assistance to the South Asian island nation, which has been surviving on $4 billion in credit lines from neighbouring India. It also has received pledges of $300 million to $600 million from the World Bank to buy medicine and other items.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last week announced the economy had “collapsed” due to dwindling foreign exchange reserves and mounting debt, worsened by the pandemic and other longer-term troubles.
The U.S. delegation was led by Robert Kaproth, deputy assistant secretary of Treasury for Asia, and Kelly Keiderling, deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia.During their four-day stay, they are meeting with a wide range of political representatives, economists, and international organizations to “explore the most effective ways for the U.S. to support Sri Lankans in need, Sri Lankans working to resolve the current economic crisis, and Sri Lankans planning for a sustainable and inclusive economy for the future,” the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.“This visit underscores our ongoing commitment to the security and prosperity of the Sri Lankan people,” said Julie Chung, U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka.
As Sri Lankans endure some of the “greatest economic challenges in their history, our efforts to support economic growth and strengthen democratic institutions have never been more critical,” she said.
The U.S. has announced $120 million in new financing for small and medium-sized businesses, a $27 million contribution to Sri Lanka’s dairy industry and $5.75 million in humanitarian assistance to help those hit hardest by the economic crisis. Another $6 million was committed to new grants for livelihoods and technical assistance on financial reform.
Sri Lanka says it’s unable to repay $7 billion in foreign debt due this year, pending the outcome of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a rescue package. It must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026. Authorities have asked the IMF to lead a conference to unite Sri Lanka’s lenders.
Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera in a tweet on Saturday evening urged people not to line up for fuel, saying new shipments would be delayed due to “banking and logistics reasons.”
He said limited stocks of fuel will be distributed to limited stations throughout next week. He said until the next shipments arrive, “public transport, power generations and industries will be given a priority.”
Residents have had to queue for hours and sometimes days to get fuel, sometimes resorting to burning charcoal or palm fronds for cooking.
Wickremesinghe said last week that the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was $700 million in debt and as a result, no country or organization was willing to provide fuel.

794,US providing anti-air defense system to Ukraine,"President Joe Biden is set to announce that the U.S. is providing an advanced a surface-to-air missile system to Ukraine, as well as additional artillery support, according to a person familiar with the matter, in the latest assistance meant to help the country defend against Russia’s four-month invasion.
The U.S. is purchasing NASAMS, a Norwegian-developed anti-aircraft system, to provide medium- to long-range defence, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. NASAMS is the same system used by the U.S. to protect the sensitive airspace around the White House and U.S. Capitol in Washington.
Additional aid includes more ammunition for Ukrainian artillery, as well as counter-battery radars, to support its efforts against the Russian assault in the Donbas, the person said.
The announcement comes as Biden is huddling with allies this week on supporting Ukraine in meetings at the Group of Seven advanced economies summit in Germany and NATO leaders’ annual gathering in Madrid.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
ELMAU, Germany (AP) — Leaders of the Group of Seven economic powers are set to commit themselves to the long haul in supporting Ukraine as they meet in the German Alps and confer by video link with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.The G-7 leaders will begin Monday’s session of their three-day summit with a focus on Ukraine. Later, they will be joined by the leaders of five democratic emerging economies — India, Indonesia, South Africa, Senegal and Argentina — for a discussion on climate change, energy and other issues.
The war in Ukraine was already at the forefront of the G-7 leaders’ minds as they opened their summit at the secluded Schloss Elmau luxury hotel on Sunday — just as Russian missiles hit the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv for the first time in weeks.
U.S. President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin “has been counting on, from the beginning, that somehow NATO and the G-7 would splinter, but we haven’t and we’re not going to.” Britain’s Boris Johnson warned the leaders not to give in to “fatigue.”
On Monday, they have the opportunity to demonstrate that unity to Zelenskyy and reaffirm their commitment to supporting Kyiv financially and otherwise.
Biden hopes to use his trip to Europe to proclaim the unity of the coalition pressing to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine as much as he is urging allies to do even more — seeking to counter doubts about its endurance as the war grinds into its fifth month.
The summit’s host, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said last week that he wants to discuss the outlines of a “Marshall plan for Ukraine” with his G-7 counterparts, referring to the U.S.-sponsored plan that helped revive European economies after World War II.
With the war still in progress and destruction mounting by the day, it’s unlikely to be a detailed plan at this stage. Scholz has said that “rebuilding Ukraine will be a task for generations.”
The G-7 already is committed to helping finance Ukraine’s immediate needs. Finance ministers from the group last month agreed to provide $19.8 billion in economic aid to help Kyiv keep basic services functioning and prevent tight finances from hindering its defence against Russian forces.A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations between the G-7 leaders, said the U.S. and Europe are aligned in their aims for a negotiated end to the conflict, even if their roles sometimes appear different.
Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron have tried to facilitate that through active conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy, while also supplying weapons to Ukraine. The U.S. has largely cut off significant talks with Russia and aims to bolster Ukraine’s battlefield capacity as much as possible so that its eventual position at the negotiating table is stronger.
The endurance of the tough sanctions on Russia may ultimately come down to whether the G-7 and other leaders can identify ways to ease energy supply issues and skyrocketing prices once winter hits, as they seek to disengage from Russian sources of fuel.
The G-7 meeting is sandwiched between a European Union summit last week that agreed to give Ukraine the status of a candidate for membership — kicking off a process that is likely to take years and whose success isn’t guaranteed — and a summit of NATO leaders starting Tuesday in Madrid.The leaders of the G-7 — the U.S., Germany, France, the U.K., Italy, Canada and Japan — may hope to make some progress in bringing their counterparts from their five guest countries closer to Western views on sanctions against Russia.
Scholz also is eager to win over such countries for his idea of a “climate club” for nations that want to speed ahead when it comes to tackling the issue.

792,Sri Lanka sends 2 ministers to Russia for oil amid crisis,"Sri Lanka is sending two ministers to Russia to negotiate for fuel — one of the necessities that the Indian Ocean island nation has almost run out of amid its ongoing economic crisis.
Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said two ministers are scheduled to leave for Russia on Monday to continue in-person talks that Sri Lanka has been having with Russian authorities to directly purchase fuel, among other related issues.
He urged people Saturday not to line up for fuel, saying new shipments would be delayed due to “banking and logistics reasons.”
He said limited stocks of fuel will be distributed to limited stations throughout next week. He said until the next shipments arrive, “public transport, power generators and industries will be given a priority.”
Residents have had to queue for hours and sometimes days to get fuel, sometimes resorting to burning charcoal or palm fronds for cooking.Wijesekera’s comments come while a high-level U.S. delegation is visiting Sri Lanka, seeking ways to help the island nation cope with an unprecedented economic crisis and severe shortages of essential supplies.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, global oil prices have skyrocketed. While Washington and its allies are trying to cut financial flows supporting Moscow’s war effort, Russia is offering its crude at a steep discount, making it extremely enticing to a number of countries.Like some other South Asian nations, Sri Lanka has remained neutral in the war in Europe.
However, Wijesekera said the foreign ministry and the Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia have been making arrangements for a fuel sale.
“There is an advantage for us if we could buy oil directly from the Russian government or the Russian firms. There are talks going on,” he told reporters Sunday.
The shortages have led to protests against the government, recently to demand fuel.
Sri Lanka says it’s unable to repay $7 billion in foreign debt due this year, pending the outcome of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a rescue package. It must pay $5 billion on average annually until 2026. Authorities have asked the IMF to lead a conference to unite Sri Lanka’s lenders.
Last month, the country bought a 90,000-metric-ton (99,000-ton) shipment of Russian crude to restart its only refinery, Wijesekera said.
In an interview with the Associated Press in mid-June, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would be compelled to buy oil from Russia, adding that his country desperately needs fuel, and was trying to get oil and coal from the country’s traditional suppliers in the Middle East.
“If we can get from any other sources, we will get from there. Otherwise (we) may have to go to Russia again,” he said.
Wickremesinghe also said last week that the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was $700 million in debt and as a result, no country or organization was willing to provide fuel.
Protesters have occupied the entrance to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s office for more than two months demanding his resignation, saying the primary responsibility for the crisis rests with him and his family, whom they accuse of corruption and mismanagement.
The U.S. delegation led by Robert Kaproth, deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for Asia, and Kelly Keiderling, deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, began its visit Sunday and is scheduled to meet top Sri Lankan officials during their stay until Wednesday.

791,"Ukraine, Russia crowd-funding gear for troops","In one of the combat zones against Russia, the supply chief for a Ukrainian fighting brigade places his online order for war supplies, a long list ranging from drones, trucks and thermal sights to batteries, generators and tape. They are needed, he writes, to equip two new battalions and “combat against armed aggression.”
In a makeshift supply depot in the capital, Kyiv, crowd-funders start busying themselves with his request. Their bustle will get the equipment to the 72nd Brigade within days, all paid for with public donations. In their ramshackle office, a poster with the Vietnam-era peace slogan exhorts: “Drop acid, Not bombs.”
With attritional combat devouring soldiers and resources, Ukraine is waging a people’s war, fought away from front lines by self-starting networks of donors and volunteers. Tech-savvy systems they’ve thrown together convert millions of dollars in donations into swift Amazon-like deliveries of war gear direct to the battlefields. They’re helping keep Ukraine in the fight at a critical juncture of the Russian invasion, as its better-supplied aggressor applies tremendous, grinding pressure on battlefields to the east and south.
Civilian volunteering is also boosting morale, providing tangible proof to Ukrainians that they’re together in their battle for survival, even if they don’t have guns in their hands. From grandmothers cutting old clothes into strips to make camouflage netting to the bereaved girlfriend of a slain soldier who walked into the supply depot after his burial saying she wanted to help, most everyone seems to be doing their bit, big and small or by direct debit.","Ukraine is waging a people’s war, fought away from front lines by self-starting networks of donors and volunteers .Tech-savvy systems have converted millions of dollars in donations into swift Amazon-like deliveries of war gear direct to the battlefields .They’re helping keep Ukraine in the fight at a critical juncture of the Russian invasion .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/global/ukraine-russia-crowd-funding-gear-for-troops,Nepal News,global,6/27/2022 13:07
790,Tokyo warned of power crunch as Japan endures heat wave,"The Japanese government warned of possible power shortages Monday in the Tokyo region, asking people to conserve energy as the country endures an unusually intense heat wave.
Weather officials have announced the earliest end to the annual summer rainy season since the Japan Meteorological Agency began keeping records in 1951. The rains usually temper summer heat, often well into July.
The economy and industry ministry urged people living in the region serviced by the Tokyo Electric Power Co. to conserve power in the afternoon, especially when demand peaks at 4-5 p.m.
Kaname Ogawa, director of electricity supply policy at the ministry, said electricity demand Monday was bigger than expected because the temperature is higher than Sunday’s forecast.
“We are struck by unusual heat for the season,” Ogawa said. “Please cooperate and save as much power as possible.”
Ogawa, however, said people should use air conditioning appropriately and take precautions against heat stroke.TEPCO is expecting contributions from the Tohoku Electric Power Co., which serves Japan’s northern prefectures, to help ease the crunch.
The Japanese archipelago has seen record high temperatures for June in some areas. In Isezaki, north of Tokyo, the temperature rose to 40.2 Centigrade (104.4 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, the highest ever for June. Temperature in downtown Tokyo rose to nearly 35C (95F) on Monday , higher than the forecast Sunday of 34C (93F).With humidity at about 44%, temperatures felt still warmer.
With hot air coming from a powerful high atmospheric pressure system stalled over the Pacific Ocean, high temperatures were expected until early July, the meteorological agency said.More than 250 people were taken to hospitals in Tokyo over the weekend for treatment of heat stroke, according to the Mainichi newspaper.
The power supply is relatively tight after Japan idled most of its nuclear reactors after 2011 meltdowns in Fukushima. It also has been closing down old coal plants to meet promises for reducing carbon emissions.
Japan also faces a potential shortage of fossil fuel imports amid sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

789,"Overcoming stigma, prejudice against people with mental illness","More than half of the people with mental illness do not receive help or hesitate to ask for help due to stigma, prejudice and discrimination against them. Such stigma or prejudices can be subtle or obvious. No matter the magnitude, it can harm and jeopardize their health even further.
The Ministry of Health and Population of Nepal estimates that about 15–20% of adolescents (2–3 million) may suffer from some form of mental disorder. The current prevalence of mental disorders among adults and children were 13.2% and 11.2% respectively. According to research by the National Health Research Council, the multi-sectoral action plan for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (2014-2020) estimated that 18% of the NCD burden is due to mental illness.
However, the present estimates of mental health problems are derived from small-scale studies in urban areas making it impossible to generalize the results in a national context. With the increasing cases of mental health illness among Nepalese; especially youth, treatment for it must be transparent and easy to access. However, the Nepalese society further adds to the burden by stigmatizing ill people and normalizing sadness, anxiety as a mere stage of human life.

784,Has Johnny been offered USD 301 m to return as Jack Sparrow?,"Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has reportedly been offered a whopping USD 301 million deal by Disney to return as the iconic 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' franchise character, Captain Jack Sparrow, claimed poptopic.com.
The Australian pop-culture gossip site claimed that ""Disney has allegedly offered Johnny Depp a USD 301 million contract deal for him to return as Jack Sparrow in another Pirates film and a Disney Plus series!""
Poptopic.com reported that as per a trusted source close to the company, ""Disney are very interested in patching up their relationship with Johnny Depp. They reached out to the actor prior to his defamation trial against Amber Heard and asked whether he would be interested in returning for another pirate film or two.""
""I know corporate sent him a gift basket with a very heartfelt letter, but I'm unsure how it was received. But what I can tell you is that the studio has already penned up a draft for a film about Jack Sparrow -- so they are very hopeful that Johnny will forgive them and return as his iconic character,"" alleged the insider.
The site's source also claimed that Disney is even willing to go beyond this deal to get Depp back into Jack Sparrow's shoes, exceeding the amount Heard's lawyer claimed that the actor would refuse.
Poptopic.com's Disney insider added, ""Disney is prepping a deal for USD$301 million deal that will include a sizable donation to a charity of Depp's choice. The deal is reportedly for Johnny Depp to return as Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 and a spin-off Disney Plus series about the early life of the Captain of The Black Pearl.""
It should be noted that this reported amount of USD 301 million is just a million over the one quoted by Heard's lawyer, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, during Depp's defamation trial. She had said, ""Is Disney aware that Mr Depp has testified under oath that he would not take another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise role for USD 300 million and a million alpacas?""
As of now, Disney has not given any confirmation or hints about Depp's return to the franchise, nor have they given any statement regarding this USD 301 million offer. Hence, there's a possibility that this might just be a rumour.
Further, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' was not the only franchise from which the actor was dropped, as Warner Bros also removed him from his role as Gellert Grindelwald in the 'Fantastic Beasts' franchise following the Washington Post op-ed by Heard, which was at the centre of Depp's highly publicised USD 50 million defamation case.
In lieu of the public defamation trial, the jury reached a verdict on June 1, deciding that Depp, proved that Heard defamed him in the 2018 op-ed. Depp has maintained that he never assaulted Heard and claimed she physically harmed him.
The jury awarded Depp USD 15 million in damages but Heard will only have to pay USD 8.4 million due to a Virginia law limiting punitive damages. In her countersuit, Heard won one of the three defamation counts and was awarded USD 2 million in damages, as per People magazine. ","Hollywood actor Johnny Depp has reportedly been offered a whopping USD 301 million deal by Disney to return as the iconic 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' franchise character, Captain Jack Sparrow, claimed poptopic.com .The site's source also claimed that Disney is even willing to go beyond this deal to get Depp back into Jack Sparrow's shoes .It should be noted that this reported amount of USD 301 million is just a million over the one quoted by Heard's lawyer, Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, during Depp's defamation trial .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/entertainment-and-lifestyle/has-johnny-been-offered-usd-301-m-to-return-as-jack-sparrow,Nepal News,entertainment-and-lifestyle,6/27/2022 7:05
783,LAFC hopeful Bale can join club within a couple weeks,"John Thorrington confirmed Sunday that Gareth Bale is joining Los Angeles FC. The timing of when that will happen remains a bit unsettled.
Thorrington, LAFC’s co-president and general manager, said after Sunday’s match against the New York Red Bulls he is hopeful Bale can arrive stateside in the next week to 10 days once all the immigration paperwork is completed.
Bale will be eligible to make his LAFC debut after the secondary transfer window opens July 7. The club’s first match after the window opens is against archrival LA Galaxy on July 8.
Thorrington left open the possibility of Bale making his debut in the rivalry game commonly known as El Trafico, but they want to assess his fitness and match readiness first.
“With our sport science team and coaches understanding how to manage a player, like Gareth, who, whether you call them a thoroughbred racehorse or Ferrari, whatever your analogy is, they do need extra attention and, care and management in order to put them in a position to succeed,” Thorrington said. “That is certainly our intention here, and we’re confident that we will be able to do that.”While most people are wondering if Bale’s arrival in Major League Soccer is primarily to help him prepare to lead Wales in the World Cup later this year, Thorrington sees Bale’s addition as another piece to help LAFC win its first MLS Cup.LAFC has been one of MLS’ top clubs since starting play in 2018. It won the Supporters Shield as the league’s top team in the regular-season in 2019, but has not had postseason success. It missed the playoffs for the first time last year.
With Sunday’s 2-0 win over the Red Bulls, LAFC is 10-3-3 and leads the league with 33 points.
The regular season ends Oct. 9, with the MLS Cup Final scheduled for Nov. 5. Wales’ first World Cup game in Qatar is Nov. 21 against the United States.
“The benefit of him joining a group like we already have is we’ll play him as much as we can. We expect him to be a top, top player for us and in this league, but we will do so sensibly,” Thorrington said. “I think when Gareth is looking at what he needs to do, his priority will be at LAFC. But we’re not naïve to the fact that he like some other players of ours have a World Cup on the horizon. How we manage his preparation ahead of that will be important to Gareth and for the success of LAFC.”
Bale’s contract with Real Madrid expires at the end of the month. He scored 106 goals in 258 appearances for Real Madrid, which won five Champions League titles and three La Liga crowns during his nine-year tenure.
Bale isn’t the only addition for LAFC. Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini is likely to be the first to arrive after agreeing to a contract a couple weeks ago. Chiellini played 17 seasons at Juventus and also played internationally for Italy, which did not qualify for the World Cup.
Thorrington also confirmed that former MLS MVP Carlos Vela has agreed to an extension. The Mexican striker’s deal was supposed to expire after Wednesday’s match against FC Dallas. Vela has six goals this season.“I think somatically it speaks to the interest of these players who still have a lot to give to a club,” Thorrington said. “This is a unique opportunity for a player like them at this stage in their career to do something a little bit different. But their priority is to come to win.”

781,Benefits of exercise resulting in a new blood molecule,"Scientists from Baylor College of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, and affiliated institutions report that they have discovered a blood molecule that is created during exercise and can significantly lower food intake and obesity in mice.
The findings of the research were published in the journal 'Nature'.
The findings improve our understanding of the physiological processes that underlie the interplay between exercise and hunger.
""Regular exercise has been proven to help weight loss, regulate appetite and improve the metabolic profile, especially for people who are overweight and obese,"" said co-corresponding author Dr Yong Xu, professor of paediatrics- nutrition and molecular and cellular biology at Baylor. ""If we can understand the mechanism by which exercise triggers these benefits, then we are closer to helping many people improve their health.""
""We wanted to understand how exercise works at the molecular level to be able to capture some of its benefits,"" said co-corresponding author Jonathan Long, MD, assistant professor of pathology at Stanford Medicine and an Institute Scholar of Stanford ChEM-H (Chemistry, Engineering & Medicine for Human Health).
""For example, older or frail people who cannot exercise enough, may one day benefit from taking a medication that can help slow down osteoporosis, heart disease or other conditions.""
Xu, Long and their colleagues conducted comprehensive analyses of blood plasma compounds from mice following intense treadmill running. The most significantly induced molecule was a modified amino acid called Lac-Phe.
It is synthesized from lactate (a byproduct of strenuous exercise that is responsible for the burning sensation in muscles) and phenylalanine (an amino acid that is one of the building blocks of proteins).
In mice with diet-induced obesity (fed a high-fat diet), a high dose of Lac-Phe suppressed food intake by about 50% compared to control mice over a period of 12 hours without affecting their movement or energy expenditure. When administered to the mice for 10 days, Lac-Phe reduced cumulative food intake and body weight (owing to loss of body fat) and improved glucose tolerance.
The researchers also identified an enzyme called CNDP2 that is involved in the production of Lac-Phe and showed that mice lacking this enzyme did not lose as much weight on an exercise regime as a control group on the same exercise plan.
Interestingly, the team also found robust elevations in plasma Lac-Phe levels following physical activity in racehorses and humans. Data from a human exercise cohort showed that sprint exercise induced the most dramatic increase in plasma Lac-Phe, followed by resistance training and then endurance training.
""This suggests that Lac-Phe is an ancient and conserved system that regulates feeding and is associated with physical activity in many animal species,"" Long said.
""Our next steps include finding more details about how Lac-Phe mediates its effects in the body, including the brain,"" Xu said. ""Our goal is to learn to modulate this exercise pathway for therapeutic interventions."" ","Scientists from Baylor College of Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, and affiliated institutions report that they have discovered a blood molecule that is created during exercise .The findings improve our understanding of the physiological processes that underlie the interplay between exercise and hunger .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/benefits-of-exercise-resulting-in-a-new-blood-molecule,Nepal News,health,6/27/2022 9:12

The disaster took place in a stadium in the city of El Espinal in Tolima state during a traditional event called “Corralejo” in which members of the public enter the ring to engage the bulls.
Videos taken during the bullfight show a multi-story section of the stands collapsing as people screamed.
“We have activated the hospital network in Tolima,” Tolima Gov. José Ricardo Orozco told local Blu Radio. “Four people have died, as of this moment: two women, a man and a minor.”
Mayor Juan Carlos Tamayo said 800 spectators were seated in the sections that collapsed.
Late Sunday, Tolima health secretary Martha Palacios said in a press conference that 322 people had gone to local public and private hospitals after the collapse seeking treatment. Palacio said the minor who had died was an 18-month-old baby.Besides the four dead, another four people were in intensive care and two others recovering from surgery.
Orozco said he had asked for the traditional “corralejas” to be suspended in Tolima earlier Sunday but this one was held anyway.President-elect Gustavo Petro urged local officials to ban such events, noting that it was not the first time an incident like this had taken place.
“I ask mayors not to allow more events involving the death of people or animals,” he said.
Current President Iván Duque on Twitter announced an investigation of the disaster.
“We lament the terrible tragedy registered in El Espinal, Tolima, during the festivals of San Pedro and San Juan, with the collapse of the stands during a corraleja. We will call for an investigation.”

769,Seeds of discord in Unified Socialist just as ministers change,"Ministers from the CPN (Unified Socialist) were finally replaced by a new set of leaders on Sunday, three weeks after the party took a decision to that effect. By the time the Cabinet reshuffle was announced, the nine-month-old Unified Socialist’s crisis had become apparent.Issuing a statement on Sunday evening, the President’s Office said the Cabinet was reshuffled on the recommendation of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.With the reshuffle, Jeevan Ram Shrestha has been appointed minister for tourism, culture and civil aviation in place of Prem Ale; Metmani Chaudhary as minister for urban development in place of Ram Kumari Jhakri, Sher Bahadur Kunwar as minister for labour, employment and social security in place of Krishna Kumar Shrestha, and Bhawani Prasad Khapung as minister for health and population. Hira Chandra KC has been appointed as minister of state for health and population in place of Khapung.The ministers were appointed after Ale and Jhakri resigned earlier in the day.The newly appointed ministers are yet to take the oath of office and secrecy.Bhesh Raj Adhikari, chief personal secretary to the President, said the newly appointed ministers will be administered the oath of office and secrecy in the first hour on Monday. Though a Cabinet reshuffle is considered a routine process, the change of ministers on Sunday comes with an indication that the Unified Socialist is going through a rough patch. The party’s Secretariat meeting on June 5 had decided to recall the ministers so as to send a new set of leaders to replace them.But the ministers defied the party orders. They, along with six other lawmakers, even submitted a memorandum on Friday to party chair Madhav Nepal expressing their displeasure over the decision, saying recalling ministers at a time when discussions were ongoing on the budget was uncalled for. The 10 lawmakers also demanded a meeting of the Parliamentary Party.But on Saturday, six lawmakers along with Ale withdrew their demand. On Sunday, Ale even submitted a letter to chair Nepal committing to stepping down whenever the party wanted him to do so.On Sunday evening, Ale and Jhakri had called separate pressers and informed the media about their works during their eight months and 20 days in office.Some in the Unified Socialist believe that the party’s June 5 decision to replace ministers was not implemented largely because of Prime Minister Deuba’s reluctance at the behest of the CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal.The Maoist Centre and the Unified Socialist are key coalition partners of Deuba.Non-implementation of the party’s decision regarding changing the ministers had put Nepal on the backfoot. Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson for the Unified Socialist, said the party’s decision to change the ministers was not implemented just because Dahal was putting pressure on Deuba.According to him, changing ministers could put pressure on Dahal as well to recall his party’s ministers.Now the party’s decision has been implemented, but insiders and observers say not everything is hunky-dory in the Unified Socialist. The party is facing a tough time. It is not happy with the current coalition but it cannot walk out of it either. Meanwhile, senior leader Jhala Nath Khanal has been calling for a “broader left alliance,” to which party chair Nepal does not seem ready.Party’s general secretary Beduram Bhusal said the crisis arose after the four ministers refused to abide by the Standing Committee decision.Political observers say since the Unified Socialist does not have any clear ideological base, its leadership is left with no option to sustain the party than promising one thing or the other to its leaders.“To manage the leaders, they were promised ministerial positions,” said Hari Roka, a political commentator. “Parties that lack ideological ground, political norms and values do what the Unified Socialist has done.”Madhav Nepal had formed the Unified Socialist in August last year by splitting from the CPN-UML after a long struggle against UML chair KP Sharma Oli. Roka said the [Cabinet] reshuffle may have some impact on the coalition partners, as there are too many aspirants seeking ministerial berths. “No one wants to serve [the people]; they just want to become ministers,” said Roka.

It's an investment that will deliver returns for everyone,” Biden said, adding that it would allow countries to “see the concrete benefits of partnering with democracies.”Biden said hundreds of billions of additional dollars could come from multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, sovereign wealth funds and others.Europe will mobilize 300 billion euros for the initiative over the same period to build up a sustainable alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative scheme, which Chinese President Xi Jinping launched in 2013, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering.The leaders of Italy, Canada and Japan also spoke about their plans, some of which have already been announced separately. French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were not present, but their countries are also participating.China’s investment scheme involves development and programs in over 100 countries aimed at creating a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route from Asia to Europe.White House officials said the plan has provided little tangible benefit for many developing countries.Biden highlighted several flagship projects, including a $2 billion solar development project in Angola with support from the Commerce Department, the US Export-Import Bank, US firm AfricaGlobal Schaffer, and US project developer Sun Africa.Together with G7 members and the EU, Washington will also provide $3.3 million in technical assistance to Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal as it develops an industrial-scale flexible multi-vaccine manufacturing facility in that country that can eventually produce Covid-19 and other vaccines, a project that also involves the EU.The US Agency for International Development (USAID) will also commit up to $50 million over five years to the World Bank’s global Childcare Incentive Fund.Friederike Roder, vice president of the non-profit group Global Citizen, said the pledges of investment could be ""a good start"" toward greater engagement by G7 countries in developing nations and could underpin stronger global growth for all.G7 countries on average provide only 0.32% of their gross national income, less than half of the 0.7% promised, in development assistance, she said.“But without developing countries, there will be no sustainable recovery of the world economy,” she said.

762,"Crisis-hit Sri Lanka shuts schools, urges work from home to save fuel","Troops in Sri Lanka handed tokens on Monday to people queueing for petrol amid a severe fuel shortage in the nation battling its worst economic crisis in seven decades, while schools shut in Colombo and public employees were asked to work from home.With its foreign exchange reserves at a record low, the island of 22 million is struggling to pay for essential imports of food, medicine and most critically, fuel.“I have been in line for four days, I haven’t slept or eaten properly during this time,” said autorickshaw driver W.D. Shelton, 67, one of those who received a token meant to hold his place in the queue for when fuel becomes available.“We can’t earn, we can’t feed our families,” added Shelton, who was 24th in line at a fuel station in the centre of Colombo, but set to stay there as he had no petrol for the journey to his home just 5 km (3 miles) away.It was not immediately clear how far the government could stretch its fuel reserves.The stockpiles stand at about 9,000 tonnes of diesel and 6,000 tonnes of petrol, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said on Sunday, but no fresh shipments are due. The government has told employees to work from home until further notice, while schools have been shut for a week in the commercial capital of Colombo and surrounding areas.Fuel station queues have grown rapidly since last week.“This is a tragedy, we don’t know where this will end,” Shelton said.Public transport, power generation and medical services will get priority in fuel distribution, with some rationed to ports and airports.A team from the International Monetary Fund is visiting Sri Lanka to hold talks on a $3-billion bailout package.Although the Indian Ocean nation is hoping to reach a staff-level agreement before the visit ends on Thursday, that is unlikely to unlock any immediate funds.

761,Japan braces for power crunch as heat mounts after rains end,"Japan scrambled on Monday to avert a looming power crunch as temperatures climbed nationwide, with authorities warning of higher than expected demand after the rainy season ended in the capital, Tokyo, at its earliest since record-keeping began.Less than two weeks ahead of an election for the upper house of parliament, surging electrical prices are making life tougher for Japanese customers, following higher fuel costs brought by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.A power shortage could batter the fortunes of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), already under fire for its handling of higher consumer prices.“Electricity demand has been staying above yesterday’s forecast since this morning, amid unseasonably intense heat,” an official of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry told a news conference, adding that demand had outstripped predictions.Tuesday was expected to be the same, it added in a statement later.At 4:00 pm, temperatures in downtown Tokyo stood at 35.1 C (95.2 F), while in Sano, slightly to the north, they were at 39.8 C (103.6 F).Ministry officials had warned reserve generating capacity would drop as low as 3.7 percent, close to a minimum of 3 percent that ensures stable supply, from 4:30 pm to 5 pm (0730 GMT to 0800 GMT) on Monday in Tokyo and eight surrounding prefectures. Below 3 percent risks power shortages and blackouts. “The supply-demand outlook, based on the latest weather forecast and other factors, is still expected to remain below the 5 percent reserve ratio during some evening hours,” the official added.If temperatures rose further and demand increased, or power supply was suddenly disrupted, the ratio could fall below the 3 percent minimum, he said.“We encourage people to cut back on energy use to a reasonable degree,” deputy chief cabinet secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki told a news conference.He advised turning off lights not in use, limiting use of air conditioners and guarding against the risk of heat stroke.Tokyo residents said they were doing their best to comply, but some queried the requests.“It’s not that I don’t get what the government’s saying, but they want us to save electricity and still use air conditioning - which seems contradictory,” said Kenichi Nagasaka, 61.Weather officials said the end of the annual rainy season across much of Japan, including the Tokyo metropolitan area, had come at its earliest since the data began to be kept in 1951.Summer heat starts with the end of Japan’s rainy season. In 2018, the June 29 end of the season brought an extremely hot summer with several heat waves that put thousands in hospital.The heat is suspected to have caused two deaths at the weekend, one of a man in his 40s who collapsed outdoors, media said.Though expected to do well in the election, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s LDP faces headwinds from rising prices, worsened by a weak yen currency.Support for his government, while strong, has been edging lower in opinion polls, with a majority of voters unhappy about efforts to hold down prices. The addition of power outages could fuel discontent.Since spring, utilities and the government have taken steps to avert a power crunch during the peak season of summer demand.They have asked families and businesses to conserve energy between July 1 and Sept. 30, while rebooting ageing gas-fired power plants and altering maintenance plans for nuclear reactors.

760,Free-roaming cats spread diseases,"For decades, scientists have warned that ecologically destructive activities increase the risk of diseases spilling over between wildlife and human populations. Examples of these drivers include climate change, habitat loss, wildlife trafficking, environmental contamination, expansion of anthropocentric activities and invasive species introduction.Domestic animals also contribute to the movement of diseases between species. Free-roaming domestic animals, like cats, can facilitate the spread and transfer of diseases, impacting both humans and wildlife.Infectious parasitesFree-roaming cats—which include feral, stray and house cats—present a particularly compelling case because of their large population sizes and their central role in the life cycle of a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii (T gondii) that infects both wildlife and humans. Most people may have only heard of toxoplasmosis from their doctors during a pregnancy or in articles on “brain-altering” parasites.However, T gondii is one of the most common zoonotic parasites globally and is estimated to affect about 30 to 50 percent of the global human population. T gondii infections can have severe and life-threatening consequences; especially for immunocompromised people and infants infected during pregnancy.Toxoplasma gondii forms a permanent resting tissue cyst in the muscle or nervous tissue of a host, so even healthy infected people are impacted. Chronic toxoplasma infections have been linked with illnesses including degenerative neurological diseases, schizophrenia and brain cancer.Domestic cats or wild felids—like lions, jaguars or cougars—intermittently excrete millions of T gondii eggs (called oocysts) into the environment through their feces. These oocysts persist under favourable conditions for years in water and soil, with the capacity for long-distance dispersal.If any warm-blooded animal ingests an oocyst, it can become infected with T gondii. This can happen if a person or animal ingests oocysts in contaminated water or food, or through eating another animal that has already become infected.Spreading diseasesAlthough both wild felids and domestic cats are sources of toxoplasma, domestic cats outnumber wild felids by several orders of magnitude. We recently tested whether mammals living in environments with greater densities of domestic cats would show higher infection rates of T gondii.While there are no global data sets showing domestic cat densities, domestic cats are closely associated with humans, and therefore, measures of human population density can act as a surrogate for the density of free-roaming cats. Using data from over 200 studies, we demonstrated that indeed, wildlife living in areas of higher human density had higher infection rates of T gondii.We concluded that this higher infection rate occurred due to a combination of two phenomenon: high densities of free-roaming domestic cats producing infected feces, and the loss of natural habitats. Natural ecosystems have important roles in filtering, sequestering and removing T gondii and other pathogens from human, livestock and wildlife exposure pathways. Breaking the lifecycle by preventing cats from hunting and landscape restoration are key preventative measures.If wildlife have an increased risk of exposure to T gondii in certain areas, then humans and livestock can also be unintended targets. Public health researchers have shown this repeatedly by sampling soil, vegetable gardens and playgrounds.Rabies riskRabies is another disease whose risk is increased by free-roaming cats. In the United States, cats are the most common rabies positive domestic species, with cats posing two-and-a-half times the rabies exposure risk compared to bats in Pennsylvania. In Canada, we recently found similar public health concerns of free-roaming cats when we examined patterns of rabies submissions of bats in Canada.In Canada, free-roaming cats were associated with 10 times more bats being submitted for rabies testing compared to indoor cats. In fact, in our dataset, there were five records of free-roaming cats bringing bats into the house that subsequently were found to be rabies positive. This hunting activity by cats is obviously dangerous for people in the household, and is a very simple explanation for cases of cryptic rabies infections (rabies cases without an identifiable source).This risk is directly proportionate to the frequency of free-roaming cats killing bats, which is unfortunately common. Single cats have been known to kill a hundred bats in a week.In our dataset, one free-roaming cat killed nine endangered little brown bats in one month, with another record of a cat killing 14 bats in a single evening. Many bat populations have undergone severe declines, especially due to an introduced fungal disease. Bats are long-lived with low reproduction, so this additional source of mortality can severely impact bat populations.Since cats only bring home 20 percent of what they kill, prey returns and rabies submissions only provide a tiny glimpse of the true cat predation rates. It is therefore apparent that although natural rabies prevalence in bats is low—less than one percent—in areas with cats killing large numbers of bats, rabies exposure risks will increase.Protecting health and wildlifeThere is broad consensus among veterinarians, ecologists, public health experts and animal rights activists that free roaming by domestic cats is detrimental for feline welfare, wildlife welfare, conservation and human health. Wildlife have the same capacity for distress and pain as domestic animals, and perform irreplaceable ecosystem services with tangible economic benefits, making their predation unjustifiable from an ethical or economic perspective.Free-roaming cats suffer from increased mortality through traumatic injury, disease, neglect and abandonment. This marginalisation of cats needs to be replaced with progressive enrichment resources and responsible management that does not foster an inhumane and biased disregard for feline welfare standards, wildlife welfare, conservation and human health.—The ConversationRead the original article here.

759,Impact small businesses make in Nepal ,"Most days, many of us walk into a small business and buy something. We take it for granted that the businesses will be there—with the goods and services we require. However, most of us don’t think that many micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) lack the finance they need to thrive. MSMEs are the essence of Nepal’s economy. They contribute significantly to the country’s economic growth by creating thousands of jobs. A United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) report estimates that the country’s MSMEs employ more than 2.7 million people. Consider some statistics. In Nepal, it’s estimated there are more than 923,000 registered businesses. Approximately 90 percent of those are MSMEs, accounting for 45 percent of all jobs. And about 12 percent are small and medium businesses, accounting for 40 percent of employment. Yet despite their prominent contribution to the economy and jobs, 37 percent of the MSMEs report access to finance as a significant constraint to growth. For MSMEs in Nepal, the projected financing gap is estimated at $3.6 billion, with only around $731 million currently available.Massive collateralConsidering the gap in financing and the funds they currently have access to, it’s clear that promoting MSME finance is critical for Nepal. This need is underscored by the fact that many commercial banks in Nepal do not differentiate much between large corporates and MSME clients. Seventeen percent of MSMEs use banks to finance investments, but the required collateral is massive, reaching up to a staggering 364 percent of the loan value. For smaller firms, access to finance is an even bigger struggle, which is why only 9 percent reportedly use bank loans.In Nepal, real estate is the only widely accepted form of collateral, and the lack of real estate collateral is cited as one of the key barriers to accessing finance. Land as collateral effectively excludes MSMEs, women-owned businesses, businesses in rural areas and start-ups, which tend to have moveable assets—like machinery which people can take with them—instead of significant real estate. Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, has been working to improve access to finance for MSMEs. Financial inclusion has been a key strategic focus of Nepal Rastra Bank, and several enabling reforms are being undertaken to boost MSME finance and digital financial services. There are some innovative solutions which can help accelerate the reform process. One such innovation began earlier this year when Nepal became the first South Asian country to pilot the Psychometric Scoring Solutions, jointly implemented by Nepal Rastra Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Psychometric tests are a standard and scientific method used to measure an individual’s mental capabilities and behavioural style. For financial institutions, the Psychometric Scoring Solutions helps them statistically analyse the personality and psychological traits of potential borrowers by generating a risk profile as a first step in building a formal credit history for someone to access formal financial services. So far, the scoring tool has been used in Morocco, Ethiopia and Senegal. This innovation, designed to facilitate more accurate credit decisions, helps spur broader access to finance through an additional layer of information consumers provide to microfinance institutions (MFIs). Small business entrepreneurs generally lack credit files and primarily operate on a cash basis. Through the Psychometric Scoring Solutions, credit providers can determine a borrower’s willingness and capacity to repay loans, making informed decisions.This innovative tool is part of a broader access to financial services project by Nepal Rastra Bank and IFC, with the support from the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom. This project aims to create the right environment for MSMEs to grow and also focuses on developing the financial and market infrastructure to strengthen MSMEs, including a robust payments system and innovative solutions to accelerate reforms.Special attentionIFC is committed to helping close the MSME financing gap in Nepal and to supporting the country’s efforts to follow a sustainable and inclusive growth trajectory. IFC’s broader strategy to strengthen SME banking involves supporting regulatory reforms, technical assistance and providing up to $170 million in financings (loans and equity), specifically on SME lending, to several banks. By the end of June 2022, IFC is looking to invest upwards of $50 million, spread over three banks in Nepal. As part of the SME Ventures programme, IFC invested in Business Oxygen (BO2)—the country’s first private equity fund—between 2015 and 2017. BO2 has made equity investments in 17 SMEs in various sectors, creating hundreds of jobs. IFC has also invested $10 million in Dolma Impact Fund II, bringing its investment in the sector to $24.3 million to date.As Nepal recovers from the impact of the pandemic, the MSME sector, which has been hit hard, clearly deserves special attention. The reform measures highlighted above will go a long way in supporting the lifeline of the Nepali economy.   ","In Nepal, the projected financing gap is estimated at $3.6 billion .Real estate is the only widely accepted form of collateral .The lack of real estate collateral is cited as one of the key barriers to accessing finance .",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2022/06/26/impact-small-businesses-make-in-nepal,Kathmandu Post,Columns ,6/26/2022 20:46
758,Dismantling Chhaupadi mindset,"The practice of secluding menstruating women in makeshift huts is still prevalent in Nepal, particularly in its remote western region. While the issue is at the core of ill treatment of women in general, the practice has debilitatingly affected disabled women who are forced into isolation. Even though the government has declared the custom illegal and imposed strict penalties on anyone making women adhere to Chhaupadi forcefully, little change has been observed in the villages when period should be considered a part of a woman’s natural biological cycle.The problems that menstruating women face haven’t been missed over the past few decades. But perhaps the issue concerning disabled women has somewhat been in the shadows. Disabled women who would otherwise need constant care and attention from their family members are left to suffer the plight in silence without any assistance. Virtually untouchable during menstruation, most disabled women and girls are left to manage on their own, and many succumb to the harsh conditions—such is the plight of women in a country where some dare to opine on the progressive steps taken towards women empowerment.Another cause for concern is the incidence of sexual attacks, particularly on disabled women. Being disabled and left unsupervised during menstruation leaves them open to attacks from sexual predators. Unable to defend themselves, they are more vulnerable to sexual crimes than those without disabilities. According to a report by the National Federation of the Disabled, 67 percent of women with disabilities are victims of violence. The Chhaupadi practise only exacerbates the problem further.It may be convenient to overlook the psychological scar that comes with being banished, in some cases, to a livestock shed every once in a while, but surely, the physical hardships and threat to life should instil better sense in society to end this evil practice. According to a study conducted by the National Human Rights Commission in 2018, at least 15 women have lost their lives since 2005 while living in makeshift Chhau sheds. Without any meaningful help, menstruating women’s lives come under constant threat.While the government has made efforts to eliminate the practice of seclusion by dismantling the existing Chhaupadi sheds, this has led to far more anguish for women and girls who, regardless, are made to continue the tradition of seclusion. Perhaps the only effective measure would be educating people to abolish this abhorrent tradition. Dismantling the menstruating sheds only seems to encourage ultra-conservatives to continue with their defiance. While laws and penalties may aid in deterring abuse, nothing is as sure as making people realise the evil inherent within this practice of Chhaupadi, which should enable them to take steps to put an end to it.

757,Covid cases rise more than two-fold in last two weeks,"Last week, two people infected with Covid-19 came in contact with doctors at Danfe Care, an organisation that provides telemedicine services. Officials at the organisation said it had been several months since anyone infected with Covid contacted them for medical help.“Patients have started contacting us for medical advice,” said Dr Prabhat Adhikari, an infectious disease and critical care expert, who is also the founder of the organisation. “Although the condition of both the patients, who are fully vaccinated, is normal, patients again started seeking medical help means cases might have increased in communities.”According to the data provided by the Ministry of Health and Population, daily numbers of polymerase chain reaction tests show an uptick in new cases. Of 6,675 polymerase chain reaction tests carried out in the last five days, 137 samples tested positive for Covid. Daily positivity rate is over two percent, which was less than one percent until a few days ago.Active cases stand at 192 throughout the country on Sunday. The number was 93 on June 14.Public health experts say although there is no need to panic as the rise in cases is small, the timing is concerning as India has been reporting a higher number of Covid cases of late.Covid cases have been rising in several states of India, including in New Delhi and Maharashtra, where thousands of Nepalis live and work and frequently travel back and forth between the two countries.India on Sunday reported a total of 11,739 new Covid-19 cases and at least 25 deaths in the last 24 hours. Reports suggest the daily Covid-19 cases are on the rise. The daily positivity rate was 2.59 percent on Saturday, while the weekly average is 3.25 percent, according to media reports.On Friday India had recorded 15,940 new Covid cases.With the decline in new cases after the third wave of Covid-19 driven by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, that started in mid January this year, life has become normal. The decline in new cases could have made people complacent— many have stopped following safety measures including wearing face masks, washing hands and maintaining social distance—despite the fact that the virus is circulating in communities.“People are getting infected every day and many infected people might not be testing,”said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at Patan Hospital. “Most of the people who seek polymerase chain reaction tests at our hospital are those going abroad.”Experts say authorities can reinforce face masks, launch awareness about the growing risks of the infection and encourage people to take booster shots. Despite the availability of sufficient Covid vaccine doses, only 21.4 percent of the total population or 6,250,027 people have received booster shots as of Sunday.Authorities concerned have even failed to administer shots to 12 to 17 year olds, despite announcing a plan.“All people who were administered a second dose three months ago should be given booster shots,”said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, an epidemiologist. As vaccines are the only reliable and proven means to lessen the severity and death from Covid, doctors say, one should not wait until a new surge to take booster shots.Experts say the rise in new cases in India is a matter of concern since there is an uninterrupted cross-border movement every day. Nepal and India share an 1,800-kilometre open border through which thousands of people cross over into each other’s territories on a daily basis.“We must be vigilant, closely monitor the surge in India and what measures are being taken in our own country,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Our own experience shows that a new surge comes if cases start rising in India rapidly.”Apart from focusing on booster shots, authorities should carry out whole genome sequencing on the swab samples of infected people to know if there is any new mutation in the virus, experts say.Doctors also call for monitoring whether the hospitalisation rate has increased or not.“Authorities should also revive contact tracing, quarantine and isolation,” said Adhikari, an infectious disease expert. “Spread of infection can be contained, if intervened in the early stage.”On Sunday, 29 people tested positive (21 in 1,077 polymerase chain reaction tests and eight in 653 antigen tests) throughout the country. Nepal has so far received 55,584,770 doses of Covid vaccines of various brands—AstraZeneca, Vero Cell, Moderna, Janssen, Sinovac-CoronaVac, and Pfizer-BioNTech—including paediatric doses.As many as 20,237,066 people or 69.3 percent of the total population have been fully immunised so far.

756,Hard times for small businesses amid economic turmoil,"Handmade paper maker Kiran Kumar Dangol has seen his income dip by 10-15 percent for the first time in his 18 years in the business due to higher costs and falling demand.“Shipping charges have soared by more than 70 percent, the cost of production has doubled, and productivity has dropped since the pandemic,” said Dangol, owner of Lotus Paper Craft.The decline in productivity and increased cost of production have made Nepali goods less competitive in the international market, he said.Dangol says the Russia-Ukraine war has been bad for his business because he ships most of his products overseas. “We use local raw materials to make Nepali handmade paper, but the price has doubled with fuel costs rising continuously,” he said. Businesses like the one Dangol owns fall under the umbrella of Micro-, Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs).June 27 is observed as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) Day, and it will hopefully shed light on the plight of domestic MSMEs like Dangol's paper factory which are going through hard times with the country in the midst of an economic crisis, insiders said.The United Nations General Assembly has designated June 27 as Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day to raise awareness about the tremendous contributions made by these firms towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.MSMEs account for 90 percent of businesses, 60 to 70 percent of employment and 50 percent of gross domestic products worldwide.MSME Day 2022 focuses on how purpose-driven micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises and social entrepreneurship are at the centre of contributing to inclusive growth, combating inequalities and building back better and stronger, especially during challenging times.“Micro, small and cottage industries are on the verge of collapse due to increased raw material prices, high interest rates and lack of access to bank loans,” said DB Basnet, chairperson of the Cottage and Small Scale Industry Committee of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry.“It has become difficult for entrepreneurs to survive because of the high cost of fuel. There is no specific data, but almost 80 percent of micro, small and cottage industries are close to collapse,” Basnet said.""Output is down, and it is not easy to get raw materials. The domestic market has also shrunk due to rising inflation, and exports have slowed as a result of high shipping costs,"" Basnet said.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, 9,486 micro, cottage and small enterprises had borrowed a combined Rs13.15 billion as of mid-May this fiscal year under the Refinance Procedure 2020.The central bank said 35,554 micro, cottage and small enterprises took loans totalling Rs35.38 billion in the last fiscal year 2020-21.Covid-19-affected tourism, cottage, small and medium industries received business continuity loans under the Business Continuity Loan Procedure 2020 to pay staff salaries.Under this provision, loans amounting to Rs1.13 billion had been approved as of mid-May 2022.""Financial burdens are being heaped on small enterprises when the sector should be recovering after the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Umesh Prasad Singh, president of the Federation of Nepalese Cottage and Small Scale Industries.“The financial situation of micro, small and cottage industries has weakened, and many entrepreneurs are unable to repay bank loans,” Singh said.“Micro, small and cottage entrepreneurs are being warned to repay their loans or face foreclosure. Such actions have discouraged many entrepreneurs from doing business. Rising interest hurts the sector where each firm provides jobs to five to 10 people,” he said.A report entitled Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Monitor published by the Asian Development Bank in December 2021 says 33.1 percent of MSMEs are using inheritance wealth or ancestral properties while 25.8 percent are using income and savings for initial financing for their business.About 85 percent of workers in Nepal are informal. The majority of MSMEs are engaged in services and operate in rural areas in the region; only a few cater to international markets, although their impact on exports varies by country.Access to bank credit remains limited for MSMEs with just 16 percent of them going to banks and financial institutions.""The situation is different in our southern neighbour,"" Singh said. ""India provides Rs2 million in seed money to micro, small and cottage enterprises with a loan payback time of five years without any interest, which encourages entrepreneurs. The government should provide loans at single-digit interest and special loans to women working in small and cottage industries,"" he said.The Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises’ Access to Finance in Nepal report, released by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in 2020, says MSMEs contribute 22 percent of Nepal's GDP.As per the Central Bureau of Statistics, almost half of all business establishments are unregistered, and more than 90 percent of workers working in MSMEs with fewer than 10 workers have informal employee relationships.The National Economic Census 2018 shows there were 923,356 establishments operating in Nepal, around half of them registered. The MSME sector—which includes 69.3 percent micro enterprises, 25.2 percent small enterprises, and 5.5 percent medium-sized enterprises—employs 2.74 million people. To boost Nepal’s development, the importance of businesses as primary contributors of growth cannot be overstated. For businesses to reach their full potential and contribute to overall national economic growth, it is fundamental to ensure an enabling environment for them to prosper, experts say.It is particularly important to facilitate the development of institutions that provide affordable and suitable financial services and products to MSMEs, they said.

Not everyone is amused","Amid rising cases of cholera in Kathmandu Valley and doctors warning about a possible outbreak, Lalitpur Metropolitan City on Sunday swung into action to control the waterborne disease.It put a blanket ban on the sale of ‘panipuri’ and ‘chatpate’—spicy street foods mostly popular among the youth.In its decision, the Lalitpur Metropolitan City has announced a complete ban on selling panipuri and chatpate on the roadsides from Monday, saying that such street food could be a major source of cholera spread. Sitaram Hachhethu, chief of the city police also known as the implementation division, said they sent over two dozen street vendors home on Sunday. “From Monday, anyone found selling these items on the streets will have their carts confiscated,” said Hachhethu. He said the City has decided to ban the roadside sale of panipuri and chatpate until cholera cases come under control. “We can’t say for how long the ban will continue but it has to be until cases come down to zero,” said Hachhethu.According to him, those who sell panipuri and chatpate do not use clean water, and on Sunday alone, 27 such vendors were sent home with a warning not to return to the streets until the ban is lifted.“We have found that they use tap water, which could increase the risk of cholera outbreak, as the disease has already been detected in the Sanepa area,” said Hachhethu.When it comes to panipuri and chatpate, they are certainly not considered hygienic foods for a number of reasons. A blanket ban on their sales, however, seems to be a hasty decision by the Lalitpur Metropolitan City (LMC).More street carts have emerged in the city areas selling these foods simply because there are consumers. Many earn a living by selling panipuri and chatpate on the streets.Rajan Basnet is one. He came to Kathmandu a decade ago and worked as a labourer at construction sites. He then saw good prospects in selling panipuri and chatpate as he could set up the business with a minimum investment. He has been selling panipuri for the last five years in front of Nightingale School at Kupondole.The City’s decision has left him worried.“I earn around Rs700 a day. My family survives on this business,” Basnet, 28, father of two sons aged two and three, and a daughter aged one, told the Post on Sunday afternoon. “My family will go hungry if I am not allowed to operate my business.”When it comes to street vendors, Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has been more notorious compared to Lalitpur. Kathmandu’s city police personnel have in the past faced much criticism for confiscating the goods of street vendors or even beating them up. There is no exact data on the number of people selling panipuri and chatpate on Lalitpur streets. Street vendors like Basnet, however, are major contributors to the economy. An analytical report on the informal sector published by the Central Bureau of Statistics in March last year shows that there are 34,101 street businesses in Nepal, which employ 45,330 people.In Bagmati Province, the number of persons engaged in street business is 9,066, which commands a 26.6 percent share of the total street business.The report shows that 12,147 street businesses have an annual turnover of less than Rs100,000 each.Similarly, 1,292 street businesses reported an annual turnover of more than Rs1 million.The report shows that 8,728 street businesses make annual profits ranging from Rs50,000 to Rs99,999 and 1,494 are running in losses.The Lalitpur Metropolitan City’s decision is likely to impact a large number of people who earn their livelihoods by selling panipuri and chatpate on the roadsides, alleys, and some open areas.According to officials, there are around 600 such vendors in the 29 wards of Lalitpur.Sundar Nepali, who has been assigned to monitor the hygiene of street food in ward no 2 of the City (Jhamsikhel area), says that in his ward there are a total of 11 such vendors, including three women who sell chatpate and panipuri on the roadsides or school areas. Satish Bista, chief of Health Office Lalitpur, said the metropolitan city’s blanket ban on panipuri and chatpate sellers does not make sense. “The City should monitor these sellers and carry out inspections so as to ensure that they are maintaining good hygiene,” said Bista. “Only those maintaining good hygiene standards should be allowed to do business and others should be punished.”Bista said he was also in the meeting that decided to impose the ban and that he opposed the decision. According to the Health Ministry, as of Sunday, nine cases of cholera have been found in Kathmandu Valley and the patients are from Sanepa, Bagbazar, Dillibazar, Balkhu, Balaju, and Kapan, among other areas. Doctors treating the patients say the presence of E coli in drinking water was the reason behind infections. Kathmandu Valley’s drinking water has never been up to the mark, and even the state-owned water utility recommends drinking water supplied by it only after boiling.Experts say the rise in cholera cases could also be due to the garbage on the streets that could not be collected for months owing to problems at the landfill sites in Nuwakot.According to them, blaming only those selling panipuri and chatpate on the streets for the cholera cases is not just wrong, but inhuman, as such a ban robs them of their livelihoods.Dr Baburam Marasani, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, said that cholera cases are being reported not only because of the panipuri sellers but also because of the government’s failure to uphold people’s constitutional right to live a healthy life. “The government itself has been distributing contaminated water. None of the government agencies are concerned about the government-supplied drinking water, which is contaminated with E coli and other pathogens,” said Marasini. “Now Lalitpur wants to prove itself as the champion in the fight against cholera and has launched a crackdown on the poor.”Basnet, the panipuri seller, claimed that he is concerned about his customers’ health and that he uses jar water and maintains the best possible level of hygiene he can. He said he is concerned about hygiene also because he wants to continue his business.“If people fall sick after eating my panipuri and chatpate, will they come to me again?” he said. “Since this is the only source of my livelihood, I have to be careful. I have to pay Rs7,000 per month in rent besides my other expenses. Can I afford to ruin my business by selling unhygienic food?”Nepali, the man assigned to inspect the hygiene of street food in the Jhamsikhel area, said that out of 11 sellers, seven use jar water and they are quite concerned about maintaining a certain level of hygiene. He also believes the metropolitan city’s decision is reactive. Chotan Prajaptai, 31, has got his cart covered with glass panes on three sides so as to shield the food from road dust. That’s his shop which he puts up every day at Arun Thapa chowk in the Jhamsikhel area. “I came to know about the decision from one of my customers,” he said. “If the authorities want to check whether I maintain hygiene, they can come and do so. Why impose a blanket ban? It’s a decision that does injustice to the poor like us.”Panipuri and chatpate vendors say they suffered a lot because of the Covid-19 pandemic, as lockdowns and threats of the coronavirus kept the consumers away. “Now by showing the threat of cholera, the authorities are cracking down on us. It’s not fair,” said Prajapati. Panipuri and chatpate are kinds of foods whose hygiene have always been in question though.Panipuri is a crispy, fried, hollow dough ball served with a fill of stuffed mashed potato and chickpeas along with spicy, tangy water. Chatpate can be made in various ways, with puffed rice as the main ingredient. It usually consists of finely chopped tomato, onion, green chilli and boiled potato together with some dry noodles and an assortment of spices.Given the ingredients and the way these street foods are usually prepared out in the open, doctors say chances of them being unhygienic are quite high. But experts insist that regulation is the way to go rather than putting a blanket ban on their sales.“It has been learnt that many popular street foods like panipuri and chatpate can spread diseases like cholera,” said Marasini. “But what about the water jars that are being sold in the market? Bottled water is also not safe. And what about some big hotels and restaurants? Who has inspected the foods they are selling?” ","Lalitpur Metropolitan City has announced a complete ban on selling panipuri and chatpate on the roadsides from Monday .Those who sell panipuri and chatpate do not use clean water, and on Sunday alone, 27 such vendors were sent home with a warning not to return to the streets until the ban is lifted .",https://kathmandupost.com/lalitpur/2022/06/27/to-curb-cholera-lalitpur-targets-street-food-sellers-not-everyone-is-amused,Kathmandu Post,Lalitpur ,6/27/2022 8:10
754,Gurdung settlement faces acute water shortages every monsoon,"Saili Tamang from Gurdung settlement in Dhunibesi Municipality gets up early in the morning and descends to the Padheri stream to bring home water. It takes nearly one hour for the 67-year-old to reach the stream and another one-and-a-half hours to return home with the water vessel.“It is very difficult for me to carry the 20-litre container filled with water. But there is no alternative. I have to stop and rest at several places,” said Saili. Her daughter-in-law also accompanies her to fetch water from the stream every morning. “Families in our settlement struggle every day to manage drinking water but the government is indifferent to our hardship despite repeated requests,” Saili said.The situation of Sharmila Tamang, aged 34, is no different from Saili’s. On top of working the field, collecting fodder for domesticated animals, preparing meals and looking after the children, she also has to worry about managing water for her family. “I have to get up before dawn to fetch water from the stream that is an hour’s walk away. Otherwise I cannot complete other household chores and work in the field,” said Sharmila.She has brought home two drums to harvest rainwater. Sharmila uses the rainwater to cook food and for other household chores. “But we have no alternative but to go to the stream to bring drinking water,” she said.There are 68 households in Gurdung settlement and all of them are reeling under acute water shortages. There is a water tap in the village but it runs dry every monsoon.The villagers had constructed a micro-hydropower project in Patheri stream eight years ago. The electricity generated by the project is used to lift water from the stream to the village. But the water supply to the tap is disrupted every rainy season as the floods in the river damage the reservoir, forcing the villagers to go to the stream to get drinking water. The government has spent millions to implement several drinking water projects to supply water to the city areas and markets but people in several rural villages are still forced to drink river water due to the non-operation of drinking water projects in the villages.Nepal's constitution defines access to clean drinking water as a fundamental right of citizens. However, people in many rural villages have been denied the right for a long time. Despite the government’s ‘one house one tap’ campaign, consumers have been forced to live with water shortages for years due to non-implementation. “Everyone from children to elderly goes to the river to fetch water. Water from the river is used for drinking while rain water is for cooking and other household chores,” said Ganga Tamang, a resident of Gurdung. “Children here sometimes have to miss school to fetch water from the stream.”The water crisis has made it difficult for villagers to grow vegetables and rear cattle, Ganga says. During every election season, candidates come to the village seeking votes and with promises of solving their drinking water crisis. But so far, none of the candidates and authorities have done anything to address their issue, the villagers say.

753,Forex reserves down to fund imports for just a little over six months raises alarm,"Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves have slid to a level to sustain imports of goods for less than seven months, for the first time in the last six years, setting off alarm bells. Even the import control measures taken by the Nepal Rastra Bank do not seem to be yielding the desired results, and economists say immediate intervention is a must.As of the first 10 months of the current fiscal year 2021-22, Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves decreased by 21.1 percent to $9.28 billion in mid-May 2022 from $11.75 billion in mid-July 2021, according to Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB).The current chest is sufficient to sustain import of goods and services for just 6.6 months against Nepal’s target of maintaining the foreign exchange reserves enough to cover imports of at least seven months. In mid-July last year, the country had foreign currency reserves adequate to import goods and services for 10.2 months. The reserves slid below the seven-month mark in November, and there has been a gradual decline since.In late April, the government banned imports of at least 10 goods, which it considers luxury or non-essential, till the end of the current fiscal year in a bid to stop the country’s foreign exchange reserves from depleting further. Imports of liquor and tobacco products, diamonds, mobile sets priced over $600, colour television sets bigger than 32 inches, jeeps, cars and vans except ambulances, motorcycles of over 250CC, dolls, cards and snacks have been banned.The government also imposed strict controls on the import of gold jewellery and hiked duty on bullion imports. Experts say questions remain whether the reported foreign exchange reserves reflect the true picture amid reports of banks and financial institutions approving large amounts of loans without the availability of loanable funds. The available forex reserves are sufficient to sustain imports of goods and services for just 6.6 months against the Nepal Rastra Bank’s policy of maintaining the reserves to sustain imports for at least seven months  Source: NRBAccording to a report published by the Post’s sister paper Kantipur on June 23, as many as 27 commercial banks approved Rs383 billion in loans as of mid-May amid liquidity shortages.“Many letters of credit (LC) might have been opened for importing goods whose payment is pending,” said Dipendra Bahadur Kshetry, a former central bank governor. “Foreign exchange reserves might decline further if payments due to all the letters of credit are made.”Citing the LC trend, experts say there has been no control on imports of the products that the government has barred from importing.Central bank officials also don’t reject such a possibility.“We don’t have details about LC related liabilities immediately,” said Prakash Kumar Shrestha, chief of the economic research section at the central bank.If the LC-related liabilities have been paid, foreign exchange reserves must be much lower than what is shown by the central bank, and officials and experts say that is a major concern.“We are at a critical juncture, which is evident from the existing level of foreign currency reserves,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the Nepal Rastra Bank. “As we have become an increasingly import-dependent country, we must have foreign currency enough to sustain imports for seven to ten months, at least.”Nepal’s ratio of imports of goods and services to gross domestic product (GDP) has been on the rise over the last decade. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the country’s estimated import to GDP ratio stood at 41.49 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to 29.17 percent in the fiscal year 2011-12.“This suggests our increasing dependence on imports for which we need more foreign currency. In fact, we rely on imports for our living and carrying out development activities,” said Thapa.In mid-August 2020, the country had foreign exchange reserves enough to sustain imports of goods and services for 15.6 months when the country had lifted a nearly four-month-long lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Not only due to increased imports of goods and services, foreign exchange reserves are facing pressure also due to rising global prices. Because of rising inflation, Nepal is facing the problem of paying more even for buying fewer goods.According to Manik Lal Shrestha, former head of the statistics division at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global rises in commodity prices are responsible for increasing Nepal's import bill by around 20 percent since the beginning of the fiscal year 2021-22.“Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, rising prices have weighed on import bills by 20 percentage points,” he said at an interaction on the country’s economy organised by the Society of Economic Journalists Nepal in Kathmandu in early May.Kshetry, the former governor, also said it is necessary to maintain foreign exchange reserves at a comfortable position considering the risk of foreign currency outflow due to rising prices of commodities and rise in import costs.In order to boost foreign exchange reserves, the country either has to control the outflow of foreign currency by strictly controlling imports of goods and services or boost exports that can earn foreign currency as well as promote other sources such as remittances, foreign aid, foreign direct investment and tourism.Officials and experts doubt if the government’s effort to control imports has worked as import figures continue to remain high.In December last year, the central bank made it mandatory for importers to keep a 100 percent margin amount to open a letter of credit to import 10 types of goods.  Post File PhotoThese goods included alcoholic drinks; tobacco; silver; furniture; sugar and foods that contain sweets; glucose; mineral water; energy drinks; cosmetics; shampoo, hair oils and colours; footwear; umbrellas; and construction materials such as bricks, marble, tiles and ceramics.Motorcycle and scooter importers had to keep 50 percent margin amount, and importers of diesel-powered private automobiles also needed to keep 50 percent margin amount compulsorily.And the central bank’s yet another directive issued on February 9 increased the number of import items requiring 100 percent cash margin to 43, while it fixed the cash margin needed for importing four types of goods at 50 percent.Monthly figures since mid-January show no significant decline in imports.For example, Nepal’s monthly import in Paush (mid-December to mid-January) stood at Rs 160.9 billion which slightly declined to Rs148.1 billion the following month (mid-January to mid-February) but again rose to Rs161.3 billion in the month of Falgun (mid-February to mid-January), according to the central bank statistics.In Baishakh (mid-April to mid-May), imports decreased to Rs137.99 billion, according to the central bank.But imports climbed to Rs158.57 billion in Jestha (mid-May to mid-June), according to the data from the Customs Department.“Import control measures have not been very effective. There has not been any significant drop in imports,” said Shrestha of the central bank. “Despite reduced credit flow, continued high imports have raised questions if they were real imports or fake and if traders have informal channels such as Hundi to make payments.”He said that as long as there are aggregate demands in the economy, the traders seek to supply whichever way possible.Continued high imports have also raised questions about the implementation of the central bank’s import control measures.“We cannot rule out the possibility of certain importers taking loans from one bank to maintain the cent percent margin in another bank to open a letter of credit to import products discouraged by the government,” said Thapa, the former executive director at the central bank. “The objective of import control measures taken by the central bank is to deny access to bank loans for importing certain goods. The measure might not have been implemented properly.”With imports continuing to remain high, despite improvement in inflows of remittances and tourism earning, there continues to be pressure on foreign exchange reserves.Yet another source of foreign currency is foreign aid. But with the government failing to spend the capital budget, there has not been any significant inflow of foreign aid in the first nine months of this fiscal year.According to the Public Debt Management Office, Nepal borrowed a total of Rs111.68 billion between the start of the current fiscal year and the third quarter.Of this, only Rs12.21 billion is from external sources and the remaining Rs99.47 billion is from internal sources. Foreign direct investment has continued to remain insignificant in the country.“The cavalier approach to foreign exchange expenses must be stopped,” said Thapa. “The government also must expedite the projects being developed under foreign aid so as to receive reimbursement in foreign currencies. More efforts should be made to attract foreign direct investment.” ","Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves have slid to a level to sustain imports of goods for less than seven months, for the first time in the last six years, setting off alarm bells .Even the import control measures taken by the Nepal Rastra Bank do not seem to be yielding the desired results, and economists say immediate intervention is a must .",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/27/forex-reserves-down-to-fund-imports-for-just-a-little-over-six-months-raises-alarm,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/27/2022 12:42
752,Transport fare decreases,"The government has decreased the public transport fare on the inter-province route. The fare of passenger and goods carrier vehicles has been slashed based on the Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC)'s decision Saturday to decrease the price of diesel and petrol.
The price of diesel has been reduced by Rs 29 per litre and that of petrol by Rs 20 per litre.
Transportation fares had been increased from time to time before this with the rise in the fuel prices.
The Department of Transport Management has slashed the fare of passenger vehicles by 5.41 per cent on the rate of fare fixed before this. As per the new transport fare fixed by the Department, the transport fare of goods carrier vehicles operating on hilly roads has been decreased by 6.97 per cent and that of goods carrier vehicles operating on the Tarai roads by 7.68 per cent.
According to the scientific fare adjustment system, the transport fare is automatically adjusted if the fuel price rises or falls five per cent or more. The transport fare had been recently adjusted on June 20 before this. ",Price of diesel has been reduced by Rs 29 per litre and that of petrol by Rs 20 per litre .Transport fare had been recently adjusted on June 20 before this .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/nation/transport-fare-decreased,Nepal News,nation,6/26/2022 17:14
751,Hong Kong’s last hand-painted porcelain factory,"Step into Yuet Tung China Works, Hong Kong’s last remaining hand-painted porcelain factory, and you find yourself surrounded by stacks of dinnerware, each piece painstakingly decorated by hand with vibrant motifs of flowers, fruits and animals.
Joseph Tso, the third-generation owner of the factory, and his small team are among the few people in Hong Kong who have mastered the traditional technique of painting “guangcai,” or Canton porcelain.
It is a fading art in this modern metropolis, as fewer young people are willing to put in the time and effort required to master the craft or to work at the factory full-time.
“The business environment in Hong Kong is not suitable for labor-intensive industries,” Tso said. “Hong Kong’s traditional handicraft industry is gradually declining. It will eventually disappear.”
Guangcai, which comes from the nearby Chinese city of Guangzhou, is characterized by an overglaze technique in which the painter sketches a design on white porcelain and then fills it in with color using thin brushes before firing the piece in a kiln.Tso’s grandfather established the factory in Hong Kong’s Kowloon City in 1928. It rose to prominence over the years, becoming famous for its delicate craftmanship and custom dinnerware.The factory is known for its Canton rose porcelain painted with a pigment called “xihong,” which means “Western red.” Its ingredients include lead oxide, quartz and gold dust.
“Hong Kong’s export sector was booming from the 1960s to the 1980s, and many well-known department stores came to buy products,” Tso said. “Foreign trade firms would bring us business from (American) department stores.”
The factory sometimes paints family crests on dinnerware for foreign customers.
Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong before the city was returned to China in 1997, visited Yuet Tung China Works to buy some porcelain before returning to Britain.
The factory is an important part of Hong Kong’s history, said Yim Wai-wai, founding president of The Hong Kong Ceramics Research Society.
“The porcelain factory breathed at the same pace as the development of Hong Kong,” said Yim. “If it ceases to exist, it will be an immeasurable loss.”","Yuet Tung China Works is Hong Kong's last remaining hand-painted porcelain factory .The factory rose to prominence over the years, becoming famous for its delicate craftmanship and custom dinnerware .The factory is known for its Canton rose porcelain painted with a pigment called ""xihong""",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/gallery/hong-kong-s-last-hand-painted-porcelain-factory,Nepal News,gallery,6/26/2022 13:01

""This is actually my first Glastonbury and I'm sharing this stage with Lily, this is the biggest dream come true ever. But I'm also equally as heartbroken about what happened in America yesterday,"" Rodrigo said.
The 19-year-old singer told in an interview, ""I'm devastated and terrified. So many women and so many girls are going to die because of this. I wanted to dedicate this next song to the five members of the Supreme Court who have showed us that at the end of the day, they truly don't give a shit about freedom. The song is for the justices: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh. We hate you! We hate you.""
Meanwhile, Phoebe Bridgers, who has been outspoken about the battle over abortion rights since news of Roe v. Wade's impending overturn by the Supreme Court was first leaked earlier this year, made no bones about her feelings during her set at the Glastonbury festival in England on Friday, as per Variety.

747,Apple's AR/VR headset expected to release in January,"According to respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's long-rumoured mixed reality headset, which will reportedly offer a mix of virtual and augmented reality experiences, ""will likely launch in January 2023.""
In a new analyst note from 9to5Mac, Kuo states that the headset is ""the most complicated product Apple has ever created,"" but that its launch could help spur ""rapid growth"" in the head-mounted display market.
This is far from the first time Kuo predicted Apple's headset could release, but previous predictions have had far more expansive release windows. Last year he said we might see the headset released at some point in 2022 (which now seems unlikely), and just this month he predicted that a release could come at some point in the second quarter of next year. Though this doesn't guarantee a January announcement, as Apple's plans could change, or Kuo's supply chain sources could be wrong, listing a specific month is a strong show of confidence from the analyst, as per The Verge.
It also coincides with much-reported activity around headsets at Apple. The company's board of directors reportedly tested the headset in early May, mentions of the headset's RealityOS software appear in Apple code and appear in trademarked apps, and Apple CEO Tim Cook said he recently teased upcoming augmented reality announcements.
Numerous reports over the years have tried to shed some light on Apple's elusive headsets. It will supposedly work as a standalone device rather than having to be plugged into a computer. Also, it could have up to 14 cameras to track its movement, according to a recent report in The Information.
Internally, it'll reportedly have a processor with a similar amount of processing power to M1 chips found in recent Macs, though when it comes to power it's unclear whether its battery will be wearable on the user's body, or built into the headset itself, as per The Verge.
While Kuo predicts Apple will make a splash in the mixed reality headset space, it is expected from its main competitor Meta to take a step back, reports 9to5Mac. Kuo expects the company formerly known as Facebook to scale back its short-term investments in virtual reality hardware to focus on its advertising business. That's despite Meta recently showing off a number of VR headset prototypes it's working on. ",Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple's mixed reality headset will likely launch in January 2023 .This is far from the first time Kuo predicted Apple's headset could release .Previous predictions have had far more expansive release windows .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/apple-s-ar-vr-headset-expected-to-release-in-january,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/26/2022 7:21
746,'Inquiring in Kathmandu no longer a compulsion',"Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Prem Bahadur Ale has said that the day of people in Sudur Paschim having to go to the airport to board a plane after inquiring about the status of flights in Kathmandu is over.Laying the foundation stone for the construction of the terminal building, baggage handling system, water fountain, canteen and gate at Geta Airport in Dhangadhi, Kailali on Saturday, he said that the situation where passengers from Sudur Paschim have to get information from Kathmandu on whether the plane arrives or not is over. ""The rule that the first flight should begin from the place where the airline company has proposed as the base station has come into effect. Hence, the first flight will now be from Dhangadhi. There is no need to ask Kathmandu whether the aircraft will arrive.""

745,"Breast cancer spreads during sleep, suggests research","According to a recent study by scientists at ETH Zurich, the University Hospital Basel, and the University of Basel, circulating cancer cells that later form metastases primarily emerge during the sleep phase of the affected individuals.
The findings of the research were published in the journal 'Nature'.
Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Each year, around 2.3 million people worldwide contract the disease. If doctors detect breast cancer early enough, patients usually respond well to treatment.
However, things become much more difficult if cancer has already metastasised. Metastasis occurs when circulating cancer cells break away from the original tumour, travel through the body via blood vessels and form new tumours in other organs.
To date, cancer research has not paid much attention to the question of when tumours shed metastatic cells. Researchers previously assumed that tumours release such cells continuously.
""When the affected person is asleep, the tumour awakens,"" summarises study leader Nicola Aceto, Professor of Molecular Oncology at ETH Zurich. During their study, which included 30 female cancer patients and mouse models, the researchers found that the tumour generates more circulating cells when the organism is asleep. Cells that leave the tumour at night also divide more quickly and therefore have a higher potential to form metastases, compared to circulating cells that leave the tumour during the day.
""Our research shows that the escape of circulating cancer cells from the original tumour is controlled by hormones such as melatonin, which determine our rhythms of day and night,"" says Zoi Diamantopoulou, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich.
Adjusting therapies to the tumour
In addition, the study indicates that the time in which tumour or blood samples are taken for diagnosis may influence the findings of oncologists. It was an accidental finding along these lines that first put the researchers on the right track, ""Some of my colleagues work early in the morning or late in the evening; sometimes they'll also analyse blood at unusual hours,"" Aceto says with a smile. The scientists were surprised to find that samples taken at different times of the day had very different levels of circulating cancer cells.
Another clue was the surprisingly high number of cancer cells found per unit of blood in mice compared to humans. The reason was that as nocturnal animals, mice sleep during the day, which is when scientists collect most of their samples.
""In our view, these findings may indicate the need for healthcare professionals to systematically record the time at which they perform biopsies,"" Aceto said. ""It may help to make the data truly comparable.""
The researchers' next step will be to figure out how these findings can be incorporated into existing cancer treatments to optimise therapies. As part of further studies with patients, ETH Professor Nicola Aceto wants to investigate whether different types of cancer behave similarly to breast cancer and whether existing therapies can be made more successful if patients are treated at different times.

744,Monkeypox not a global emergency ‘at this stage’,"The World Health Organization said the escalating monkeypox outbreak in more than 50 countries should be closely monitored but does not warrant being declared a global health emergency.
In a statement Saturday, a WHO emergency committee said many aspects of the outbreak were “unusual” and acknowledged that monkeypox — which is endemic in some African countries — has been neglected for years.
“While a few members expressed differing views, the committee resolved by consensus to advise the WHO director-general that at this stage the outbreak should be determined to not constitute” a global health emergency, WHO said in a statement.
WHO nevertheless pointed to the “emergency nature” of the outbreak and said controlling its spread requires an “intense” response.
The committee said the outbreak should be “closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks.” But it would recommend a re-assessment before then if certain new developments emerge — such as cases among sex workers; spread to other countries or within countries that have already had cases; increased severity of cases; or an increasing rate of spread.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus convened the emergency committee on Thursday after expressing concern about the epidemic of monkeypox in countries that haven’t previously reported the disease.“What makes the current outbreak especially concerning is the rapid, continuing spread into new countries and regions and the risk of further, sustained transmission into vulnerable populations including people that are immunocompromised, pregnant women and children,” the WHO chief said.
Monkeypox has sickened people for decades in central and west Africa, but until last month, the disease had not been known to cause significant outbreaks in multiple countries at the same time and involving people with no travel links to the continent.
Declaring a global health emergency means that a health crisis is an “extraordinary” event requiring a globally-managed response and that a disease is at high risk of spilling across borders. WHO previously made similar declarations for diseases including COVID-19, Ebola in Congo and West Africa, Zika in Brazil and the ongoing effort to wipe out polio.
The emergency declaration mostly serves as a plea to draw more global resources and attention to an outbreak. Past announcements have had a mixed impacts, given that WHO is largely powerless when trying to convince countries to act.
WHO said this week it has confirmed more than 3,200 monkeypox infections in about 40 countries that haven’t previously reported the disease. The vast majority of cases are in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men and more than 80% of the cases are in Europe.
A leading WHO adviser said last month the spike in cases in Europe was likely tied to sexual activity by men at two raves in Spain and Belgium, speculating that its appearance in the gay and bisexual community was a “random event.” British officials have said most cases in the U.K. involve men who reported having sex with other men in venues such as saunas and sex clubs.Scientists warn that anyone in close, physical contact with someone infected with monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of catching the disease, regardless of their sexual orientation.
People with monkeypox often experience symptoms like fever, body aches and a rash; most recover within weeks without needing medical care.
Monkeypox in Africa mostly affects people who come into contact with infected wild animals, like rodents or primates. There has been about 1,500 reported cases of monkeypox, including 70 deaths, in Congo, Cameroon and the Central African Republic.
To date, scientists haven’t found any mutations in the monkeypox virus that suggest it’s more transmissible or lethal, although the number of changes detected show the virus has likely been spreading undetected for years.
The version of the disease transmitting beyond Africa typically has a fatality rate of less than 1%, while the version seen in Africa can kill up to 10% of people affected.
WHO is also creating a vaccine-sharing mechanism for monkeypox, which could see vaccines go to rich countries like Britain, which currently has the biggest outbreak beyond Africa.Some experts warned that could entrench the deep inequities seen between rich and poor countries during the coronavirus pandemic.
“France, Germany, the U.S. and U.K. already have a lot of resources and plenty of vaccines to deal with this and they don’t need vaccines from WHO,” said Dr. Irwin Redlener, an expert in disaster preparedness and response at Columbia University.
“What we should be doing is trying to help the countries in Africa where monkeypox has been endemic and largely neglected,” he said. “Monkeypox is not COVID, but our attention should not be so distorted that it only becomes a problem when it is seen in rich countries.”

743,"Consuming cranberries enhances memory, curbs bad cholesterol","The latest research at the University of East Anglia (UK) has indicated the neuroprotective potential that cranberries possess and that adding them to one's diet can significantly enhance memory and curb unhealthy cholesterol.
The research team studied the benefits of consuming the equivalent of a cup of cranberries a day among 50 to 80-year-olds.
They hope that their findings could have implications for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia.
Lead researcher Dr David Vauzour, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: ""Dementia is expected to affect around 152 million people by 2050. There is no known cure, so it is crucial that we seek modifiable lifestyle interventions, such as diet, that could help lessen disease risk and burden.
""Past studies have shown that higher dietary flavonoid intake is associated with slower rates of cognitive decline and dementia. And foods rich in anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, which give berries their red, blue or purple colour, have been found to improve cognition.
""Cranberries are rich in these micronutrients and have been recognized for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
""We wanted to find out more about how cranberries could help reduce age-related neurodegeneration.""
The research team investigated the impact of eating cranberries for 12 weeks on brain function and cholesterol among 60 cognitively healthy participants.
Half of the participants consumed freeze-dried cranberry powder, equivalent to a cup or 100g of fresh cranberries, daily. The other half consumed a placebo.
The study is one of the first to examine cranberries and their long-term impact on cognition and brain health in humans.
The results showed that consuming cranberries significantly improved the participants' memory of everyday events (visual episodic memory), neural functioning and delivery of blood to the brain (brain perfusion).
Dr Vauzour said: ""We found that the participants who consumed the cranberry powder showed significantly improved episodic memory performance in combination with an improved circulation of essential nutrients such as oxygen and glucose to important parts of the brain that support cognition -- specifically memory consolidation and retrieval.
""The cranberry group also exhibited a significant decrease in LDL or 'bad' cholesterol levels, known to contribute to atherosclerosis -- the thickening or hardening of the arteries caused by a build-up of plaque in the inner lining of an artery.
This supports the idea that cranberries can improve vascular health and may in part contribute to the improvement in brain perfusion and cognition.
""Demonstrating in humans that cranberry supplementation can improve cognitive performance and identifying some of the mechanisms responsible is an important step for this research field.
""The findings of this study are very encouraging, especially considering that a relatively short 12-week cranberry intervention was able to produce significant improvements in memory and neural function,"" he added.
""This establishes an important foundation for future research in the area of cranberries and neurological health.""
The study was supported by a grant from The Cranberry Institute. It was led by the University of East Anglia in collaboration with researchers at the Leiden University Medical Center (Netherlands), the University of Parma (Italy) and the Quadram Institute (UK). ",Researchers studied the benefits of consuming the equivalent of a cup of cranberries a day among 50 to 80-year-olds .They hope that their findings could have implications for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia .The study is one of the first to examine cranberries and their long-term impact on cognition and brain health in humans .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/consuming-cranberries-enhances-memory-curbs-bad-cholesterol,Nepal News,health,6/26/2022 10:41
742,Gareth Bale signs with MLS leaders Los Angeles FC,"Los Angeles FC has reached a deal with Welsh forward Gareth Bale to move to Major League Soccer after his departure from Real Madrid, a person close to the deal told The Associated Press.The person spoke Saturday on condition of anonymity because the details of the 12-month deal are still being finalized between Bale and MLS-leading LAFC, which also added Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini to its roster this month.The 32-year-old Bale is moving stateside after spending most of the past nine years with Madrid. His contract expires this summer, making him a free agent after his up-and-down tenure with the current Champions League winners finally ends.
Bale essentially confirmed the move with a tweet Saturday, writing, “See you soon, Los Angeles,” alongside a video of himself in an LAFC jersey and hat.
Bale is among the most dynamic attacking players of his generation when healthy and on a top team. He scored 106 goals in 258 appearances for Madrid, which won five Champions League titles and three La Liga crowns during his tenure.But Bale has played sparingly and occasionally ineffectively for Madrid in recent years. He made only seven appearances for the European champions this past season while struggling with several injuries.
Bale also went on a season-long loan to Tottenham in 2020-21, scoring 16 goals in 34 appearances for Spurs. The brilliant goal-scorer joined Madrid from Spurs in 2013 for a then-record transfer fee.Bale will get a fresh start in the Southern California sunshine alongside Chiellini, who joined LAFC after 17 seasons at Juventus and an impressive international career for Italy.
Bale was rumored to be considering retirement if Wales hadn’t qualified for the World Cup, but his national team earned a place in Qatar last month. Bale will be able to chase a trophy in Los Angeles while staying in shape for the rigors of the World Cup competition.
The MLS regular season ends Oct. 9, while the MLS Cup Final — the last potential game of the MLS season — is scheduled for Nov. 5, just over two weeks before the start of the World Cup.
Bale and Chiellini both would be eligible to debut for LAFC after the secondary transfer window opens July 7. LAFC hosts the archrival LA Galaxy on July 8.
They are expected to join a formidable core alongside Mexican striker and former MLS MVP Carlos Vela, whose tenure at LAFC is expected to be extended after his own contract expires this summer.
LAFC is signing both Chiellini and Bale with targeted allocated money, a distinction that leaves open a designated player slot if the club decides to add yet another star player who can be paid above the MLS salary cap.
LAFC has been among MLS’ top teams since its founding as an expansion franchise in 2018, but while it won one Supporters’ Shield as the regular-season champions, the club has yet to raise the league’s postseason trophy.

President of Federation Kumar Karki said the government should encourage the entrepreneurs in the country and assure them easy access to the customs points.
""Training centres should be established to produce human resources needed for the industries,"" he added. Likewise, he asked the government to coordinate with the private sector to run the sick industries and provide collateral-free loans to the business persons. The Federation has urged the government to embrace special policies to ensure self-employment for the returnee migrant workers.

740,Abortion ruling thrusts companies into divisive arena,"The Supreme Court’s decision to end the nation’s constitutional protections for abortion has catapulted businesses of all types into the most divisive corner of politics.
Some companies that stayed silent last month — when a draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to Politico — spoke up for the first time Friday, including The Walt Disney Company, which said it will reimburse employees who must travel out of state to get an abortion.
Facebook parent Meta, American Express, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs also said they would cover employee travel costs while others like Apple, Starbucks, Lyft and Yelp reiterated previous announcements taking similar action. Outdoor clothing maker Patagonia went so far as to post on LinkedIn Friday that it would provide “training and bail for those who peacefully protest for reproductive justice” and time off to vote.
But of the dozens of big businesses that The Associated Press reached out to Friday, many like McDonald’s, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Tyson and Marriott did not respond. Arkansas-based Walmart — the nation’s largest employer with a good portion of its stores in states that will immediately trigger abortion bans following the Friday’s Supreme Court ruling — also kept quiet.Meanwhile, the Business Roundtable, an organization that represents some of the nation’s most powerful companies, said it “does not have a position on the merits of the case.”
A lot is at stake for companies, many of which have publicly pledged to promote women’s equality and advancement in the workplace. For those in states with restrictive abortion laws, they could now face big challenges in attracting college-educated workers who can easily move around.
Luis von Ahn, the CEO of the language app Duolingo, sent a tweet Friday aimed at lawmakers in Pennsylvania, where the company is headquartered: “If PA makes abortion illegal, we won’t be able to attract talent and we’ll have to grow our offices elsewhere.”
The ruling and the coming patchwork of abortion bans also threatens the technology boom in places like Austin, Texas as companies like Dell -- which was already becoming more flexible to remote work because of the tight labor market -- struggle to recruit newly minted tech graduates to their corporate hubs, said Steven Pedigo, a professor who studies economic development at the University of Texas at Austin.
“Rather than stay in Austin, do you go to New York or Seattle or the Bay Area? I think that’s a real possibility,” Pedigo said. “It becomes much more challenging, particularly when you’re looking at a young, progressive workforce, which is what technology workers tend to be.”
Emily M. Dickens, chief of staff and head of government affairs for the Society for Human Resource Management, said in a statement that nearly a quarter of organizations in a recent poll agreed that offering a health savings account to cover travel for reproductive care in another state will enhance their ability to compete for talent.
“But how these policies interact with state laws is unclear, and employers should be aware of the legal risks involved,” she said.Dickens noted that companies that use third-party administrator to process claims on their behalf — typically big employers — are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act rather than state law. But companies that have to buy their own health insurance for their employees — typically small businesses — are subject to state regulations and have less flexibility in designing benefits.
Offering to cover travel expenses could also make companies a target for anti-abortion lawmakers. In March, Texas State Representative Briscoe Cain, a Republican, sent a cease-and-desist letter to Citigroup, saying he would propose legislation barring localities in the state from doing business with any company that provides travel benefits for employees seeking abortions.
In his concurring opinion released Friday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested it would be unconstitutional for a state to bar residents from traveling to another state to get an abortion.
“In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel,” Kavanaugh wrote.
But a corporation’s right to fund what would be an illegal act in another state is still questionable, argues Teresa Collett, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas.“That’s not an interstate commerce question, per se,” she said. “So you’d need the right plaintiff.”
Meanwhile, tech companies are facing tough questions about what they’ll do if some of their millions of customers in the U.S. are prosecuted for having an abortion. Services like Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft routinely hand over digital data sought by law enforcement agencies pursuing criminal investigations. That’s raised concerns from privacy advocates about enforcers of abortion laws tapping into period apps, phone location data and other sensitive online health information.
A letter Friday from four Democrats in Congress called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the phone-tracking practices of Google and Apple, warning that location identifiers used for advertising could fall into the hands of prosecutors or bounty hunters looking “to hunt down women who have obtained or are seeking an abortion.”
The Supreme Court ruling comes at a time when companies have become increasingly reliant on women to fill jobs, and especially as they face a nationwide labor shortage. Women now account for nearly 50% of the U.S. workforce, up dramatically from 37.5% in 1970 — three years before the Supreme Court ruled abortions to be legal in Roe vs. Wade — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Denied access to abortion could hit low-income workers the hardest because they’re typically in jobs with fewer protections and that are also demanding, from loading groceries onto store shelves to working as a health aide.
“As a direct result of this ruling, more women will be forced to choose between paying their rent or traveling long distances to receive safe abortion care,” said Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union, which represents nearly 2 million janitors, health care workers and teachers in the U.S. “Working women are already struggling in poverty-wage jobs without paid leave and many are also shouldering the caregiving responsibilities for their families, typically unpaid.”
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants told The Associated Press that the ruling was “devastating.”
“It cuts to the core of all the work that our union has done for 75 years,” she said. “This decision is not about whether or not someone supports abortion. That’s the distraction ... This is about whether or not we respect the rights of women to determine their own future.”Maurice Schweitzer, a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, said the handful of companies are taking a stand on the court’s ruling because their customers and employees are expecting them to speak out.
“We’re in this moment in time where we’re expecting corporate leaders to also be leaders in the political sphere,” he said. “A lot of employees expect to work in companies that not only pay them well, but whose values are aligned with theirs.”
But the vast majority of executives will likely avoid the thorny topic and focus on things like inflation or supply chain disruptions, he said.
That, too, comes with risks.
“They can either support travel for out-of-state care and risk lawsuits and the ire of local politicians, or they can not include this coverage and risk the ire of employees,” Schweitzer said.

736,Iraqi caretaker PM in Iran to rekindle talks with Saudis,"Iraq’s caretaker prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi arrived in Iran on Sunday, state TV reported, on a visit aimed at reactivating Baghdad-mediated talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi officially received Al-Kadhimi, who was slated to also meet with other officials in Tehran, according to the report. He was the first foreign leader to visit Iran after Raisi took power in August.
Al-Kadhimi’s office said Saturday he arrived in the Saudi city of Jiddah for an official visit to meet with Saudi officials. It was his second visit to Saudi Arabia since he took the post of prime minister in May 2020.
Iran, the largest Shiite Muslim country in the world, and Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties in 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Angry Iranians protesting the execution stormed two Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran, fueling years of animosity between the nations.The Saudi-Iran talks aimed at defusing yearslong tensions between the regional foes began quietly in Iraq’s capital in 2021. Saudi Arabia sought a way to end its disastrous war against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The conflict has spawned one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters and brought bombs from rebel drones and missiles raining down on Saudi airports and oil facilities.Besides Yemen, Iran and Saudi Arabia support opposite sides in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East. Iraq borders both Iran and Saudi Arabia and is often caught in the middle of the two nations’ proxy wars.

735,China sends 29 warplanes into Taiwan's air defense zone,"China has sent 29 warplanes into Taiwan's air defence zone, according to media reports, marking the third-largest fly-by in the country this year.
The warplanes, which include 17 fighter jets, six bombers and other supporting aircraft, have entered the island's air defense identification zone on Tuesday from the southwest, The Star newspaper reported citing the island's defense ministry.
""In response, the air force scrambled jets, issued radio warnings and deployed air defense missile systems to monitor their activities,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Earlier on Friday, a US Navy P-8A Poseidon reconnaissance plane flew over the Taiwan Strait.
The flyover of surveillance plane over the Taiwan Strait was a demonstration of the US ""commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" amid recurrent Chinese incursion in Taiwan's ADIZ, US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement.
The issue of Taiwan has been at the forefront of US-China relations in recent months.
Tensions between Washington, which is committed to supporting the island's self-defence, and Beijing over Taiwan were in the open earlier this month when their respective defense chiefs met at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference in Singapore.
Taiwan and mainland China have been governed separately since the defeated Nationalists retreated to the island at the end of the Chinese civil war more than 70 years ago.
But China's ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views the self-ruled island as part of its territory -- despite having never controlled it.

734,UN allocates USD 10 million to quake-hit Afghanistan,"United Nations has allocated USD 10 million from the UN Central Emergency Response Funds (UNCERF) on Sunday to support the people of Afghanistan affected by the earthquake that struck this week in the eastern part of the country.
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths stated that the UN has released USD 10 million from UNCERF for the affected people of Afghanistan to help with the immediate response, The Khaama Press newspaper reported.
""Hundreds of people killed. Many more injured. Homes destroyed. Children buried in the rubble. The #AfghanistanEarthquake is the latest tragedy to befall the country. I released $10 million from @UNCERF to help with the immediate response,"" Griffiths said in a tweet.
UN's assistance comes as several organisations from all over the world have been supporting the people badly affected by the earthquake by providing large sums of money.
On Wednesday, a 5.9-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of Afghanistan including the capital city Kabul. At present, over 1000 people are estimated to have been killed across Barmal and Giyan districts in Paktika province, and Spera district in Khost province. In addition, at least 1,455 people have been injured across three of the six most affected districts of Barmal, Giyan, and Spera - many of them seriously. Over 10,000 houses have been destroyed.
In wake of this, India handed over the second batch of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan on Friday in the presence of Taliban officials.
The relief assistance handed over by the Ministry of External Affairs Joint Secretary (PAI), JP Singh consisted of essential items including family ridge tents, sleeping bags, blankets, sleeping mats, etc to support the people of Afghanistan in quake-affected regions.
The first consignment from India was handed over on Thursday. India also deployed a team to the Embassy in Kabul to coordinate the efforts of stakeholders for the delivery of humanitarian aid. The Taliban welcomed India's decision to return its technical team to continue humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan.
Earlier, the European Commission also announced 1 million euros in humanitarian funding for an estimated 270,000 people living in the affected areas requiring emergency assistance.
Immediate humanitarian assistance was dispatched to affected areas on June 22, including 10 tons of medical supplies sufficient for 5,400 surgeries and medical treatments covering 36,000 people for three months by WHO.","A 5.9-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of Afghanistan including the capital city Kabul .Over 1000 people are estimated to have been killed across Barmal and Giyan districts in Paktika province, and Spera district in Khost province .At least 1,455 people have been injured across three of the six most affected districts of Barmal, Giyan, and Spera .In wake of this, India handed over the second batch of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan on Friday .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/global/un-allocates-usd-10-million-to-quake-hit-afghanistan,Nepal News,global,6/26/2022 19:13

728,Airlines aim to shift blame for flight problems to FAA,"Airlines under scrutiny for widespread flight disruptions are renewing their criticism of the government agency that manages the nation’s airspace, saying that understaffing at the Federal Aviation Administration is “crippling” traffic along the East Coast.
Airlines for America, which represents the largest U.S. carriers, said Friday it wants to know FAA’s staffing plans for the July Fourth holiday weekend, “so we can plan accordingly.”
The comments from the industry group could serve as a pre-emptive defence in case airlines again suffer thousands of canceled and delayed flights over the holiday weekend, when travel is expected to set new pandemic-era highs.
“The industry is actively and nimbly doing everything possible to create a positive customer experience since it is in an airline’s inherent interest to keep customers happy, so they return for future business,” Nicholas Calio, president of the trade group, said in a letter to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.Calio said airlines have dropped 15% of the flights they originally planned for June through August to make the remaining flights more reliable, they are hiring and training more pilots and customer-service agents, and giving passengers more flexibility to change travel plans.
Calio said air traffic is often disrupted “for many hours” because bad weather causes the the FAA to issue delays.
“However, we have also observed that FAA (air traffic control) staffing challenges have led to traffic restrictions under blue sky conditions,” he added.
The FAA shot back, with a reference to taxpayer money that airlines received after the pandemic devastated air travel.
“People expect when they buy an airline ticket that they’ll get where they need to go safely, efficiently, reliably and affordably,” the FAA said in a statement. “After receiving $54 billion in pandemic relief to help save the airlines from mass layoffs and bankruptcy, the American people deserve to have their expectations met.”
The FAA said it has added controllers in high-traffic areas and added alternate routes to keep planes moving.
The airline trade group chief’s comments came a week after Buttigieg called airline leaders to a virtual meeting and threatened to punish carriers that fail to meet consumer-protection standards set by his department, which includes the FAA.
Buttigieg said he called the meeting after being alarmed by the high number of canceled flights around Memorial Day — more than 2,700 in a five-day stretch, according to tracking service FlightAware.
Thunderstorms can quickly snarl air traffic during the summer, but airlines have also acknowledged staffing shortages — they are hiring at a rapid pace to replace tens of thousands of workers whom the airlines paid to quit when travel collapsed in 2020. Pilot union leaders say their groups are being stretched to the limit, and more pilots report being fatigued.
The FAA has admitted that it too is understaffed, particularly at a key air traffic control center in Florida.Calio said that facility, near Jacksonville, Florida, has been understaffed for 27 of the last 30 days, “which is crippling to the entire East Coast traffic flows.”
More than 600 U.S. flights had been canceled and more than 4,200 delayed by early afternoon Friday, according to FlightAware. That was better than Thursday, however, when thunderstorms on the East Coast contributed to more than 800 cancellations and 6,600 delays.

725,Research finds mites live on skin of human's face,"A new DNA analysis reveals the reason behind odd mating habits, body features and evolutionary future of mites that live in the hair follicles of humans.
According to new research, tiny mites that live in human pores and breed on our faces at night are becoming such simplified organisms due to their unusual lifestyles that they may soon become one with humans.
The research was led by Bangor University and the University of Reading, in collaboration with the University of Valencia, University of Vienna and the National University of San Juan. The findings of the research were published in the journal 'Molecular Biology and Evolution'.
The mites are passed on during birth and are carried by almost every human, with numbers peaking in adults as the pores grow bigger. They measure around 0.3mm long, are found in the hair follicles on the face and nipples, including the eyelashes, and eat the sebum naturally released by cells in the pores. They become active at night and move between follicles looking to mate.
The first-ever genome sequencing study of the D. folliculorum mite found that their isolated existence and resulting inbreeding is causing them to shed unnecessary genes and cells and move towards a transition from external parasites to internal symbionts.
Dr Alejandra Perotti, Associate Professor in Invertebrate Biology at the University of Reading, who co-led the research, said: ""We found these mites have a different arrangement of body part genes to other similar species due to them adapting to a sheltered life inside pores. These changes to their DNA have resulted in some unusual body features and behaviours.""
The in-depth study of the Demodex folliculorum DNA revealed: Due to their isolated existence, with no exposure to external threats, no competition to infest hosts and no encounters with other mites with different genes, genetic reduction has caused them to become extremely simple organisms with tiny legs powered by just 3 single cell muscles. They survive with the minimum repertoire of proteins - the lowest number ever seen in this and related species.
This gene reduction is the reason for their nocturnal behaviour too. The mites lack UV protection and have lost the gene that causes animals to be awakened by daylight. They have also been left unable to produce melatonin - a compound that makes small invertebrates active at night - however, they are able to fuel their all-night mating sessions using the melatonin secreted by human skin at dusk.
Their unique gene arrangement also results in the mites' unusual mating habits. Their reproductive organs have moved anteriorly, and males have a penis that protrudes upwards from the front of their body meaning they have to position themselves underneath the female when mating, and copulate as they both cling onto the human hair.
One of their genes has inverted, giving them a particular arrangement of mouth-appendages extra protruding for gathering food. This aids their survival at young age.
The mites have many more cells at a young age compared to their adult stage. This counters the previous assumption that parasitic animals reduce their cell numbers early in development. The researchers argue this is the first step towards the mites becoming symbionts.
The lack of exposure to potential mates that could add new genes to their offspring may have set the mites on course for an evolutionary dead end, and potential extinction. This has been observed in bacteria living inside cells before, but never in an animal.
Some researchers had assumed the mites do not have an anus and therefore must accumulate all their faeces through their lifetimes before releasing it when they die, causing skin inflammation. The new study, however, confirmed they do have anuses and so have been unfairly blamed for many skin conditions.
Dr Henk Braig, co-lead author from Bangor University and the National University of San Juan, said: ""Mites have been blamed for a lot of things. The long association with humans might suggest that they also could have simple but important beneficial roles, for example, in keeping the pores in our face unplugged.""","Tiny mites that live in human pores and breed on our faces at night may soon become one with humans .The mites are passed on during birth and are carried by almost every human, with numbers peaking in adults as the pores grow bigger .The first-ever genome sequencing study of the D. folliculorum mite found that their isolated existence and resulting inbreeding is causing them to shed unnecessary genes and cells .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/research-finds-mites-live-on-skin-of-human-s-face,Nepal News,health,6/26/2022 15:04

The song on Punjab's water issue, talks about the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal, which has been an apple of discord between Punjab and Haryana for quite a long time.
Composed by Sidhu Moose Wala before he was shot dead on May 29, the music video was released by producer MXRCI on Friday, June 23 on YouTube. However, on clicking the link of the video, a message gets displayed now, saying, ""This content is not available on this country domain due to a legal complaint from the government.""
The song talks about undivided Punjab, the 1984 anti-Sikh Riots and its videos shows the Sikh flag being hoisted at the Red Fort during the farmer agitation.
Since its launch, Moose Wala's song SYL has garnered over 27 million views on YouTube and got 3.3 million likes.
Sidhu Moose Wala was shot dead by assailants in Jawaharke village of Punjab's Mansa district on May 29.
The incident took place a day after his security was withdrawn by the Punjab police among 424 others. Notably, the singer had joined the Congress party last year in December ahead of the Assembly elections.
Canada-based gangster Goldy Brar had claimed responsibility for Moose Wala's murder in a Facebook post. Goldy Brar is a close aide of gang leader Lawrence Bishnoi, who is the chief suspect in the Punjabi rapper's murder.","The song on Punjab's water issue, talks about the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal .Since its launch, Moose Wala's song SYL has garnered over 27 million views on YouTube .

723,"'Rage Against the Machine' to donate USD 475,000 in ticket sales","Popular rock band 'Rage Against the Machine' has decided to donate nearly half a million dollars to reproductive rights organizations in Wisconsin and Illinois, as announced by the band on Instagram Friday night.
The band revealed that it has raised USD 475,000 through the sale of charity tickets for their concerts at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in Elkhorn, Wis. and United Center in Chicago, Ill, as per Variety.
""We are disgusted by the repeal of Roe V. Wade and the devastating impact it will have on tens of millions of people. Over half of the country (26 states) is likely to ban or seriously restrict abortion very soon, if not immediately, which will have a disproportionate impact on poor, working class and undocumented BIPOC communities,"" the group wrote.
""Like the many women who have organized sophisticated railroads of resistance to challenge these attacks on our collective reproductive freedom, we must continue to resist,"" they added.
The statement comes after Friday's news of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, completely rejects the 1973 ruling that guaranteed federal constitutional protection of abortion rights.
'Rage Against the Machine' are among the many artists who have spoken out following the Supreme Court decision. Phoebe Bridgers raised her voice at the Glastonbury Festival in England and led a chant of ""F*** the Supreme Court!"" On the other hand, Billie Eilish also expressed her outrage on stage, stating, ""Today is a really, really dark day for women in the U.S.""
Other notable artists, including Taylor Swift, Mariah Carey, and Harry Styles, have also taken a stand on social media to address the issue.
Also on Friday, Lizzo announced that she would be donating USD 500,000 from her upcoming 'Special' tour to support abortion groups.

721,"Explorers find WWII Navy destroyer, deepest wreck discovered","A U.S. Navy destroyer that engaged a superior Japanese fleet in the largest sea battle of World War II in the Philippines has become the deepest wreck to be discovered, according to explorers.
The USS Samuel B. Roberts, popularly known as the “Sammy B,” was identified on Wednesday broken into two pieces on a slope at a depth of 6,985 meters (22,916 feet).
That puts it 426 meters (1,400 feet) deeper than the USS Johnson, the previous deepest wreck discovered last year in the Philippine Sea also by American explorer Victor Vescovo, founder of Dallas-based Caladan Oceanic Expeditions. He announced the latest find together with U.K.-based EYOS Expeditions.
“It was an extraordinary honor to locate this incredibly famous ship, and by doing so have the chance to retell her story of heroism and duty to those who may not know of the ship and her crew’s sacrifice,” Vescovo, a former Navy commander, said in a statement.The Sammy B. took part in the Battle off Samar, the final phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, in which the Imperial Japanese Navy suffered its biggest loss of ships and failed to dislodge the U.S. forces from Leyte, which they invaded earlier as part of the liberation of the Philippines.According to some records, the destroyer disabled a Japanese heavy cruiser with a torpedo and significantly damaged another. After having spent virtually all its ammunition, she was critically hit by the lead battleship Yamato and sank. Of a 224-man crew, 89 died and 120 were saved, including the captain, Lt. Cmdr. Robert W. Copeland.
According to Samuel J. Cox, a retired admiral and naval historian, Copeland stated there was “no higher honor” then to have led the men who displayed such incredible courage going into battle against overwhelming odds, from which survival could not be expected.
“This site is a hallowed war grave, and serves to remind all Americans of the great cost born by previous generations for the freedom we take for granted today,” Cox said in a statement.
The explorers said that up until the discovery, the historical records of where the wreck lay were not very accurate. The search involved the use of the deepest side-scan sonar ever installed and operated on a submersible, well beyond the standard commercial limitations of 6,000 meters (19,685 feet), EYOS said.","A U.S. Navy destroyer that engaged a superior Japanese fleet in the largest sea battle of World War II in the Philippines has become the deepest wreck to be discovered .The USS Samuel B.

720,Climate change negatively impacts bumble bees,"A recent study by researchers discovered that changes in temperature negatively impact several species of bumble bees over the past 120 years. A group of researchers revealed that change in temperature has a negative impact more than other factors- precipitation or floral resources.
The research findings were published recently in Biology Letters.
""Bumble bees are important pollinators for wild plants and for the crops humans rely on for food. That's why we need to develop conservation strategies that account for the future impacts of climate change on bee populations,"" says study lead Hanna Jackson, a Masters student in the M'Gonigle Lab in biological sciences at Simon Fraser University.
Jackson and her colleagues analyzed an existing dataset containing records on 46 bumble bee species across North America between 1900 - 2020. They created two occupancy models - one focused on time and the other on environmental factors - to estimate effects of climate and land-use variables on species' occupancy, a measure of where species are found. They found that six bumble bee species decreased through time, 22 increased and the remaining 18 were stable.
They note that temperature and precipitation both increased, on average, between 1900 and 2020 in the post-industrial revolution period. Temperature changes had primarily negative impacts on bumble bees, with 37 of the 46 species exhibiting greater declines or less positive increases in occupancy under observed temperature changes compared to if the temperature had remained constant.
Importantly, nine species of bumble bee exhibited declines that link to changing temperatures within their ranges. The team did not find patterns in the other factors that were studied, such as precipitation and only one species declined based on floral resources.
In fact, both floral resources and precipitation had mixed results. Approximately half of the bumble bee species were negatively impacted by changes in precipitation or floral resources while the other half were positively impacted.

711, The case of the footprints ,"Police constable Shankar Chettri stood up from his chair, felt his head swim, and then sat back again. His seat was still, but the world around him seemed to turn. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath and clutched the arm of his chair with both hands.“Are you alright, constable Shankar?” a voice floated to his ears, and he almost jumped to his chair. The incidents of the past few days had left constable Chettri shaken. A few days ago, Chettri almost got shot by a criminal, and since then, he hadn’t been his usual carefree self. “I’m sorry, boss. It’s just that I..”“You don’t have to be sorry, Shankar. It’s perfectly fine. You put your life at risk to catch a criminal,” said police inspector Ravi Pandey placing his hands on Chettri's left shoulder. “The department thinks you need a break.""“That’s really kind of you, boss. But you don’t understand. Working on cases makes me feel alive. If I don't work, I become sweaty and jittery. I need some action, and I need it quickly.""Pandey drew a deep breath and said, “I won’t force you to take a break, Shankar. But, whenever you feel like having one, just tell me. I will grant you two weeks of paid leave.”Just then, the phone rang. Chettri immediately picked up the receiver and answered the call.“Hello, this is Nepal Police. How can we help you?”He could hear someone breathing heavily from the other end. Chettri sank to his chair and held his breath while waiting for the caller to speak. “Hello, police. I think there is a ghost in my house,” the lady whispered.“I’m sorry, ma'am. Can you repeat that?”“A ghost. There's a ghost in my house. Please come as soon as possible. I was in my house's hallway when I heard a noise from the first floor. I went upstairs to check, and I saw this man with a very fair complexion. The sight scared me and I looked away and screamed. When I checked again, the man had already disappeared. I live alone in my house, and for the last few days, I have felt the presence of someone else in the house. Please come save me,"" she said. Chettri's heart began to race.The lady then proceeded to give her address. The police department debated whether to send their officers to attend to such an absurd case. “I don’t think we should investigate ghosts. We are the police, not ghosthunters,” said Pandey.Chettri stood still and stroked his chin. He didn't agree with his senior's assessment. “The way in which she said it was very convincing. She seemed genuinely scared,” said Chettri.Pandey agreed to let Chettri check on the lady. The house was located in Gyaneshwor. When Chettri rang the house's doorbell, he suddenly felt the whole thing was childish and wanted to return to the police station. But before he could change his mind, a lady opened the door. He could see fear in her eyes. Chettri took out his pistol, signalled the lady to stay quiet, and started searching the house. He checked the house thoroughly and didn't see anyone. He then checked the windows for any signs of a break-in. There were none. At this point, he decided to have a conversation with the lady.The lady’s name was Sunita Bista.“Ma'am, I just checked everything, and I don't think there is anybody else in the house besides you. Are you sure you saw someone?""“Yes, I am sure I saw someone. He had a very, very fair complexion and receding hairline. He was wearing a pant and nothing else. He even had red hair on his chest,"" said Bista. “Do you have any idea how the person must’ve entered your house, ma'am?”Chettri paused. A set of large footprints on the floor caught his attention. “Are those your footprints, ma'am?”“No. They are too big to be mine. Those must be the man’s footprints.”Chettri took out his phone and took a few photos of the footprints. He knew that the lady was telling the truth; someone had indeed entered the house. He assured the lady that the police would look into the case and left.The next day, the police started asking the lady's neighbours if they had seen a very pale-skinned man with red hair in the neighbourhood. Everyone said they hadn't seen anyone that fit the police's description. Meanwhile, the forensics team that had examined the photographs of the footprints informed Chettri that the suspect was around 5’10"" man with a slight limp on his left leg.A few days later, Chettri was patrolling the lady's neighbourhood and he decided to visit her. As he neared her house, what he saw shocked him. He saw a man with very pale skin and red hair sitting near the window of the second floor of the lady's house.He immediately radioed his senior and asked for backup. When he got information that the backup was nearby, he knocked on the Bista's house door.She greeted Chettri casually and asked him to come in.“Ma'am, who is the guy walking around on the second floor?” Chettri asked.The lady staggered backwards and uttered a sharp cry, “Is he up there? Please save me.”The woman began to tremble, and Chettri held her hand and told her to calm down. Just then, the backup team arrived at the location. He asked a police officer to take the woman somewhere safe. Chettri and Pandey led two teams of officers and started searching the house. For the next two hours, the two teams checked the entire house, but they didn't find anybody. Pandey turned to Chettri and asked, ”Shankar, are you sure you saw the man in this room? Ever since the shooting incident, you have been acting strange. Are you sure you didn’t just imagine all these things?”Chettri felt insulted by Pandey's remarks, making him very angry. He stared at Pandey, and a nervous silence lingered in the room. The junior officers in the room looked at one another uncomfortably. Just then, everyone heard a creaking sound come from the attic. Pandey signalled everyone to head to the attic quietly. When they opened the door to the attic, they saw a man hiding there. When the officers shone their flashlights on the man, he started pleading,“Please do not hurt me. I am not trying to harm anyone. I just wanted someplace to stay. I swear to god, I haven’t hurt anyone. Please believe me.”When the person emerged from the darkness, the police realised that the man was a person with albinism, which explained the woman's description.The police arrested the man immediately and took him to the police station. The man confessed that he was a homeless man who had been living in the lady’s attic for a week. One day she had left the house unlocked to buy groceries, and he had snuck into her home to steal food. But when she returned earlier than he had expected, he hid in her closet. Soon, he discovered the attic and camped there, coming out only twice or thrice a day to get food and to use the bathroom on the second floor. Inspector Pandey apologised to Chettri for insulting him. Chettri finally decided to take two weeks of paid leave. ","A few days ago, Chettri almost got shot by a criminal .Since then, he hadn’t been his usual carefree self .The department thinks you need a break. But you don’t understand.Working on cases makes me feel alive. If I don't work, I become sweaty and jittery.

710,Indian railway contractor threatens to quit over delays,"The Indian contractor building a cross-border railway has threatened to pull out of the project because land compensation disputes remain unresolved, preventing work from being done, officials said.The broad-gauge railway being built in south-eastern Nepal will extend 18.6 km and link Katahari, Morang with Bathnaha, India. The IRs3.8 billion project is funded by the Indian government.The scheme got bogged down in land compensation issues, and the builder Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) has told the authorities it will leave if the problems are not sorted out within two months.The Nepal government has acquired 119 bighas for IRCON subsidiary IRCON International to lay the track. The project is part of the Indian plan to build electric broad-gauge lines connecting five major industrial areas in Nepal to its rail network.Passenger and freight trains will run on the railway. Freight trains will bring raw materials to the factories and transport their finished goods to market.The Indian portion of the railway track which is 5 km long was completed three years ago. Work on the 13.6-km section in Nepal has stopped for months following disagreements over land compensation.Jiban Ghimire, Province 1 lawmaker and former minister for social development, on Tuesday drew the attention of the Provincial Assembly to the stalled project. Ghimire has requested the assembly members to take the issue seriously. The railway line was originally slated to be completed in October 2016. Construction work on the Indian side was completed on schedule. On the Nepal side, work came to a standstill because of disagreements with landowners over compensation.Aman Chitrakar, spokesperson for the Department of Railways, said IRCON had raised concern over the delay. He added that the local administration should mobilise security to resume work.According to Deepak Kumar Bhattarai, director general of the department, the compensation disputes are related to a 2-km stretch of the Biratnagar-Bathnaha railway line.""The landowners have petitioned the Supreme Court demanding fair compensation. They say the compensation offered by the government is too little,” he said. “The case is sub judice. We cannot comment on it,"" Bhattarai said. Kashiraj Dahal, chief district officer of Morang, said initially there were compensation disputes at several stretches of the railway track alignment.“Some disputes have been settled following the Supreme Court’s order to provide fair compensation. There are still disagreements on some stretches. Work cannot be resumed by mobilising the police because the case is sub judice. We cannot impose force. We have to wait for the court’s verdict,"" he said.Officials say they are not sure about the verdict coming any time soon.Dissatisfied with the amount fixed by the Compensation Determination Committee of the government, 22 landowners have filed cases at the Supreme Court.Bishwanath Majhi, secretary of the Land Acquisition Struggle Committee, an ad-hoc committee formed to exert pressure on the government, said they had been forced to knock on the court’s door because the government did not heed the landowners' demands.Initially, the Land Evaluation Committee of the government had fixed the valuation rate of seven types of land in the southern part of Biratnagar-Rangeli road.But in the northern part, the valuation was made for only four types of land, which prompted landowners to launch a protest. There were no disputes when the railway yard and station in Katahari Municipality-1, which lies 2 km north of the Biratnagar-Rangeli road, was being built. “We have been hit hard,"" Majhi, a farmer, said. “As we were not satisfied with the land valuation, we decided to launch a protest.” Initially, the evaluation committee had fixed the compensation at Rs200,000 per kattha. Majhi said that when the project started, only three farmers had filed cases at the Supreme Court over the compensation offered by the government.The court then ordered the government to pay Rs800,000 per kattha. But the government was unwilling to pay the same amount of compensation to other landowners.“We were forced to knock on the court’s door to get equal compensation,” said Majhi.He said that land values had increased sharply, reaching Rs2 million per kattha in the area. ""We are offering our land to the government. If we don’t get fair compensation, we have to go to court,"" he said.“We are not against development. If the government provides appropriate compensation, we are ready to withdraw the case,” Majhi said.The government had acquired 119 bighas from 565 people in Katahari, Budhanagar and Jatuwa, Biratnagar for the construction of the broad gauge railway line, and distributed compensation with a minimum valuation of Rs90,000 to Rs2.5 million per kattha.The Indian government had revised the target of completing the project by 2018. The Indian side had been repeatedly requesting the government to resolve the issue.As per the agreement between Nepal and India, Nepal will resolve the issues related to land and the Indian government will construct the infrastructure. Last year, the compensation issue had forced the Indian company to stop construction work on the railway line up to Biratnagar-18, Lawaghat.The project subsequently moved ahead and finished laying sleepers on the track ballast in October.Bhattarai said that the remaining work from Lawaghat to Rangeli road—laying sleepers on the track ballast—was in the final stages.Nine months ago, the Indian government had awarded a contract worth Rs450 million to IRCON International for the construction of a railway in the northern part of Rangeli road. There will be one station in Bhediyari, India and one each in Budhanagar and Katahari on the 18.61 km line. According to the project, only the Katahari station remains to be built. On October 22, 2021, acting on behalf of the government of India, IRCON International handed over the 34.9-km section from Jayanagar to Kurtha to Nepal.  ","The Indian contractor building a cross-border railway has threatened to pull out of the project because land compensation disputes remain unresolved .The broad-gauge railway being built in south-eastern Nepal will extend 18.6 km and link Katahari, Morang with Bathnaha, India .The IRs3.8 billion project is funded by the Indian government .Work on the 13.6-km section in Nepal has stopped for months following disagreements over land compensation .",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-1/2022/06/26/indian-railway-contractor-threatens-to-quit-over-delays,Kathmandu Post,Province No. 1 ,6/26/2022 17:18
709,Three ruling parties want seat-sharing arrangement before poll dates are set,"Within November, the country will hold general and provincial elections, if the government preparations and the Election Commission recent statements are anything to go by.The current coalition of the five parties—Nepali Congress, CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janamorcha—is set to contest the polls under an electoral alliance, like in the local elections, if things do not go awry.Seat-sharing, however, is going to become a big headache for Congress President and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.Some top leaders of the Maoist Centre, Unified Socialist and Janata Samajbadi have conveyed to Deuba that seat-sharing arrangements should be fixed before the poll dates are announced, according to multiple people the Post spoke to.For almost a week or so, Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, United Socialist chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and their Janata Samajbadi counterpart Upendra Yadav have been holding meetings regularly in order to fix their common position on seat-sharing, according to a senior Congress leader.“We have information that the three leaders have met multiple times somewhere in Lalitpur,” said the Congress leader. “They are in a bid to put pressure on the Congress to finalise the number of seats to be divided among coalition partners before the poll dates are announced.”If the elections were to be held by November-end, the government has to announce the dates by the end of next month, so as to give the Election Commission 120 days for its preparations. In that case, the three coalition partners want an agreement on seat-sharing within July. In the House of Representatives, there are 165 seats up for grabs while 330 will be elected to seven provincial assemblies under the first-past-the-post system. The focus, however, is more on the House of Representatives that elects the prime minister.The Congress plans to keep 100 seats for itself while letting the three other partners divide the remaining 64 seats among themselves, as one seat has to be given to Rastriya Janamorcha.Ruling party leaders said coalition partners are discussing the possible seat-sharing arrangements for the upcoming two elections.“We are of the view that some kind of agreement on how to divide seats should be reached before the announcement of the election dates,” said Haribol Gajurel, a senior Maoist leader. Asked if his party chair has been meeting Nepal and Yadav to discuss seat divisions, Gajurel refused to provide a direct answer but said as much: “Informal discussions are taking place.”“Before reaching any understanding, leaders will discuss the issue within their respective parties as well,” said Gajurel.A leader close to Deuba confirmed that three key coalition partners have been putting pressure on the prime minister on reaching an agreement before the announcement of poll dates.The Maoist Centre is looking for at least 65 seats, but it may settle for 50. If 20 seats were to be set aside for the Unified Socialist and 18 to 20 to the Janata Samajbadi, the Congress would be left with 74-75 seats for it, which the party members may not agree with. The Maoist Centre won 36 seats under the first-past-the-post system in the last elections. Of the 24 members of the Unified Socialist who actually came from the UML after a split in August, 13 are directly elected. Of the 19 members of the Janata Samjbadi in the current House, 12 had won under the direct election system. “During informal talks, leaders of the three coalition partners have said they want to contest elections where they had won in the 2017 elections. But we are of the view that Congress should contest in at least 100 constituencies,” said the Congress leader. “This is going to be a huge debate in the coming days within the party.”According to the leader, Congress members won’t agree on less than 100 constituencies. “That is our bottom line… we will have 100 constituencies and the rest 65 should be divided among the coalition partners,” the leader told the Post, wishing not to be named.Though Congress members were against contesting the May 13 local polls under an alliance with the coalition partners, Deuba remained adamant.While the Congress emerged as the largest party, the Maoist Centre got a new lease of life from the local elections. Buoyed by the wins, its chair Dahal now has his bargaining power increased.Now Dahal, a seasoned player in factional politics—he had formed his own faction within the then Nepal Communist Party against KP Sharma Oli—seems to be creating a group of three coalition partners to pile pressure on Deuba.A Unified Socialist leader said that the last-minute decision on seat-sharing during the local polls had affected results of the three parties, so leaders of his party, the Maoist Centre and Janata Samajbadi want a concrete arrangement before the poll dates are announced. The Unified Socialist is miffed at the Congress and the Maoist Centre for not treating it on par during the local elections.While presenting a political document at the party’s politburo, Unified Socalist chair Nepal said that the Congress and the Maoist Centre benefited the most from the alliance in the local elections.“In most of the local units, only the Congress and Maoist Center forged an alliance,” Nepal notes in his political report.And Deuba seems to be in for walking a tightrope.If he fails to assuage the concerns of his coalition partners, especially the two communist forces, he fears a repeat of 2017 when the elections were swept by the “left alliance”.After failing to reach an “honourable” seat-sharing arrangement, the Maoist Centre had broken the alliance with the Congress and joined hands with the CPN-UML.A left alliance again could cost Deuba and the Congress dearly. So far, chances of Dahal and Nepal joining hands with the UML are slim, but observers say it is a little too early to predict anything.During a meeting with the party’s members in the National Assembly, UML chair Oli said on Thursday that in 2017, the left alliance was born out of a sudden decision and that this could happen again.“As of now, there has been no new development on forging an alliance with anyone,” said Oli. “But any sudden decision like 2017 might happen.”Even though three of the key coalition partners are for fixing seats before poll dates are announced, the Congress does not seem to be too keen to do so. “There are still six months for elections,” said Ram Chandra Poudel, a senior Congress leader. “The focus certainly is on going to the polls jointly.”According to Poudel, there is no discussion among the ruling parties about reaching an agreement on sharing the seats at this time.“An agreement of seat-sharing arrangements will be reached two to three months ahead of the elections,” he said. ","Maoist Centre, Unified Socialist and Janata Samajbadi have conveyed to Deuba that seat-sharing arrangements should be fixed before the poll dates are announced .In the House of Representatives, there are 165 seats up for grabs while 330 will be elected to seven provincial assemblies under the first-past-the-post system .",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/06/26/three-ruling-parties-want-seat-sharing-arrangement-before-poll-dates-are-set,Kathmandu Post,Politics ,6/26/2022 8:20
708,Kantipur-HISSAN Edu Fair’s second day sees increased footfall,"The Kantipur-HISSAN Edu Fair drew a large number of students, parents and representatives from educational institutions on its second day. The seventh edition of the fair, organised jointly by Kantipur Publications and Higher Institutions and Secondary Schools’ Association Nepal (HISSAN), opened at the Bhrikutimandap Exhibition Hall in Kathmandu on Friday.An estimated 50,000 students visited the fair on its second day, a steep rise from 25,000 on Friday, according to organisers.The fair targets students seeking to pursue their higher-secondary and undergraduate studies in Nepal. Themed ‘Excellent Education in Nepal,’ the fair aims to establish that students don’t necessarily have to go abroad to pursue quality education, according to organisers.Most of the students the Post talked to expressed their gratitude to organisers. Finding information about dozens of colleges in a single venue was convenient and effective, said the visiting parents and students. The fair brought down weeks of hectic travel to survey and find the best fit for their academic journey to a single day, they said.“Getting to know about dozens of potential colleges for my further studies in just one day is a blessing,” said Prashim Timilsina, 14, who is awaiting his SEE results.

706,"Pro-life is not just opposing abortion, Vatican says after US ruling","Anti-abortion activists should be concerned with other issues that can threaten life, such as easy access to guns, poverty and rising maternity mortality rates, the Vatican’s editorial director said on Saturday.In a media editorial on the United States Supreme Court's ruling to end the constitutional right to abortion, Andrea Tornielli said those who oppose abortion could not pick and choose pro-life issues. “Being for life, always, for example, means being concerned if the mortality rates of women due to motherhood increase,” he wrote.He cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing a rise in maternity mortality rates overall and that the rate was nearly three times higher for black women.“Being for life, always, means asking how to help women welcome new life,” he wrote, citing an unsourced statistic that 75 percent of women who have abortions live in poverty or are low-wage earners.He also cited statistics from the Harvard Review of Psychiatry showing that the United States has much lower rates of paid parental leave compared with other rich nations.“Being for life, always, also means defending it against the threat of firearms, which unfortunately have become a leading cause of death of children and adolescents in the US” he wrote.The Roman Catholic church teaches that abortion is murder because life begins at the moment of conception and ends with natural death.Pope Francis has compared having an abortion to “hiring a hit man” to eliminate a problematic person.But he has tried to steer the US Catholic Church away from seeing abortion as the single, overarching life issue in the country's so-called culture wars.The death penalty, gun control, support for families, and immigration are also life issues, he has said.The Vatican’s Academy for Life praised Friday’s US Supreme Court ruling, saying it challenged the world to reflect on life issues, but also called for social changes to help women keep their children. US President Joe Biden, a lifelong Catholic, condemned the ruling, calling it a “sad day” for America and labelling the court’s conservatives as “extreme”.

705,"Public transport, cargo fares come down","The Department of Transport Management on Sunday reduced the freight charges and public transport fares in response to the reduction in fuel prices.Fares on public transport plying on inter-provincial routes have been slashed by 5.41 percent. According to the department, freight charges of the cargo carriers plying on the hills route has come down 6.97 percent and that in the Tarai by 7.68 percent.The government on April 30 decided to implement an automated pricing system. Under the system, the government, which regulates the fares, can revise the rates when the prices of petroleum products fluctuate by more than 5 percent.With the latest revision, the fare in Kathmandu-Dhangadhi-Sitagadhi-Sanfebagar route, which is 899.6 kilometres and the longest, will now cost Rs2,733. It was Rs2,889.On Saturday, Nepal Oil Corporation decreased the price of petrol and diesel/kerosene by Rs20 per litre and Rs29 per litre respectively. Petrol now costs Rs179 per litre and diesel/kerosene is available at Rs163 per litre. The new rates came into effect on Saturday midnight.The move to cut the prices followed instructions from the House committee on Friday, amid concerns over rising inflation.  ","Freight charges on the hills route has come down 6.97 percent and that in the Tarai by 7.68 percent .The government on April 30 decided to implement an automated pricing system .The move to cut the prices followed instructions from the House committee on Friday, amid concerns over rising inflation .",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/26/public-transport-cargo-fares-comes-down,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/26/2022 14:05
704,Taliban calls for release of frozen funds after deadly earthquake,"Afghanistan’s Taliban administration on Saturday called on international governments to roll back sanctions and lift a freeze on central bank assets following the earthquake that killed more than 1,000 people and left thousands homeless.The 6.1-magnitude quake that struck the east of the country early on Wednesday destroyed or damaged 10,000 homes and injured about 2,000 people, straining the country’s fragile health system and posing a major test for the ruling Taliban. “The Islamic Emirate is asking the world to give the Afghans their most basic right, which is their right to life and that is through lifting the sanctions and unfreezing our assets and also giving assistance,” Abdul Qahar Balkhi, foreign affairs ministry spokesman, told Reuters in an interview.While humanitarian aid continues to flow to Afghanistan, funds needed for longer-term development were halted when the Taliban seized control of the country in August 2021 as foreign forces withdrew.The administration of the hard line Islamist group is not formally recognised by international governments.Billions of US dollars in Afghan central bank reserves remain frozen overseas and sanctions hamper the banking sector as the West pushes for concessions on human rights.Western governments are particularly concerned about the rights of women and girls to work and study under Taliban rule. In March, the group stopped high schools for girls from opening.Asked about the issue, Balkhi said Afghans’ right to life-saving funds should be the priority, adding that the international community handled concerns over human rights differently depending on the country involved.“Is this rule universal? Because the United States just passed an anti-abortion law,” Balkhi said, referring to the Supreme Court’s overturning on Friday of the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that recognised a woman’s right to an abortion.“Sixteen countries in the world have taken away the rights of religious minorities, especially Muslims ... are they also facing sanctions because they are violating rights?,” he asked.White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said on Saturday the US government was working on “complicated questions about the use of these (frozen central bank) funds to ensure they benefit the people of Afghanistan and not the Taliban.”She added that the US Agency for International Development was providing assistance with humanitarian organisations.

703,Russia steps up missile strikes on Ukraine as G7 leaders gather,"Russian missiles hit an apartment block and kindergarten in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, in strikes US President Joe Biden condemned as “barbarism” as world leaders gathered in Europe to discuss further sanctions against Moscow.Up to four explosions shook central Kyiv in the early hours, in the first such attack on the city in weeks. Two more blasts were heard on the southern outskirts of the city later in the day, a Reuters reporter said.“The Russians hit Kyiv again. Missiles damaged an apartment building and a kindergarten,” said Andriy Yermak, head of the president’s administration.A Reuters photographer saw a large blast crater by a playground in a kindergarten that had smashed windows.Ukraine’s police chief, Ihor Klymenko, said on national television that five people had been wounded, and police later said one person was killed.Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukraine this weekend, which has also seen the fall of a strategic eastern city to pro-Russian forces.“It’s more of their barbarism,” said Biden, referring to the missile strikes on Kyiv, as leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) rich democracies gathered for a summit in Germany.Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said G7 countries should respond to the latest missile strikes by imposing further sanctions on Russia and providing more heavy weapons to Ukraine.As Europe’s biggest land conflict since World War Two entered its fifth month, the Western alliance supporting Kyiv was starting to show signs of strain as leaders fret about the growing economic cost.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the West needed to maintain a united front against Russian President Vladimir Putin.“The price of backing down, the price of allowing Putin to succeed, to hack off huge parts of Ukraine, to continue with his programme of conquest, that price will be far, far higher,” he told reporters.MISSILES HIT CENTRAL CITYLife had been returning to normal in Kyiv after fierce resistance held off Russian advances in the early phase of the war, although air raid sirens regularly sound across the city.There had been no major strikes on Kyiv since early June.The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on the Telegram messaging app that Sunday’s strike had partially destroyed a nine-storey apartment building in the historic Shevchenkivskiy district of central Kyiv and caused a fire.“There are people under the rubble,” Klitschko said. “They have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they’re trying to rescue her mother.”A Ukrainian air force spokesperson said the strike was carried out with between four to six long-range missiles fired from Russian bombers more than 1,000 kilometres away in the southern Russian region of Astrakhan.He said some of the incoming missiles were shot down.Two Russian missiles also struck the central city of Cherkasy, which until now had been largely untouched by bombardment, according to regional authorities, who said one person had been killed and five others wounded.Russia’s defence ministry said it had used high-precision weapons to strike Ukrainian army training centres in the regions of Chernihiv, Zhytomyr and Lviv, an apparent reference to strikes reported by Ukraine on Saturday.There was no immediate comment about Sunday’s strikes on Kyiv or Cherkasy.Russia denies targeting civilians, but Ukraine and the West accuse Russian forces of war crimes in a war that has killed thousands, sent millions fleeing Ukraine and destroyed cities.Eastern battlefieldThe strategic eastern battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk fell to pro-Russian forces on Saturday after Ukrainian troops retreated, saying there was no longer anything to defend in the ruined city after months of fierce fighting.It was a major defeat for Kyiv as it seeks to keep control of the eastern Donbas region.Russia’s TASS new agency quoted a pro-Russian separatist official saying its forces were advancing on Lysychansk, across the river from Sievierodonetsk, and had entered the city’s industrial zone.The two cities were the last major cities held by Ukrainian forces in the east.Moscow says the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces in Donbas, where it has backed uprisings since 2014, are independent countries. It demands Ukraine cede the entire territory of the two provinces to separatist administrations.In the Ukrainian-held Donbas town of Pokrovsk, Elena, an elderly woman from Lysychansk in a wheelchair, was among dozens of evacuees who arrived by bus from frontline areas.“Lysychansk, it was a horror, the last week. Yesterday we could not take it any more,” she said. “I already told my husband if I die, please bury me behind the house.”Global food suppliesRussia invaded Ukraine on February 24 in what the Kremlin called a “special military operation” it said was needed to rid the country of dangerous nationalists and ensure Russian security. Kyiv and the West dismiss that as a pretext for a land grab.The war has had a huge impact on the global economy and European security, driving up gas, oil and food prices, pushing the European Union to reduce reliance on Russian energy and prompting Finland and Sweden to seek NATO membership.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said he would urge his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to start a dialogue during a peace-building mission to the warring countries and would ask Putin to order an immediate ceasefire.“War has to be stopped and global food supply chains need to be reactivated,” Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said before leaving to attend the G7 summit.The United Nations has warned that a protracted war in Ukraine, one of the world’s major grain exporters, threatens to cause a global hunger crisis.Seeking to further tighten the screws on Russia, G7 countries announced an import ban on new gold from Russia as they started their summit in the Bavarian Alps.NATO leaders will hold a June 29-30 summit in Madrid.

701,Banking body urges decisive wave of global rate hikes to stem inflation,"The world’s central bank umbrella body, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has called for interest rates to be raised “quickly and decisively” to prevent the surge in inflation turning into something even more problematic.The Swiss-based BIS has held its annual meeting in recent days, where top central bankers met to discuss their current difficulties and one of the most turbulent starts to a year ever for global financial markets.Surging energy and food prices mean inflation in many places is now its hottest in decades. But the usual remedy of ramping up interest rates is raising the spectre of recession, and even of the dreaded 1970s-style “stagflation”, where rising prices are coupled with low or negative economic growth.“The key for central banks is to act quickly and decisively before inflation becomes entrenched,” Agustín Carstens, BIS general manager, said as part of the body’s post-meeting annual report published on Sunday.Carstens, former head of Mexico’s central bank, said the emphasis was to act in “quarters to come”. The BIS thinks an economic soft landing - where rates rise without triggering recessions - is still possible, but accepts it is a difficult situation.“A lot of it will depend on precisely on how permanent these (inflationary) shocks are,” Carstens said, adding that the response of financial markets would also be crucial.“If this tightening generates massive losses, generates massive asset corrections, and that contaminates consumption, investment and employment - of course, that is a more difficult scenario.”World markets are already suffering one of the biggest sell-offs in recent memory as heavyweight central banks like the US Federal Reserve - and from next month the ECB - move away from record low rates and almost 15 years of back-to-back stimulus measures.Global stocks are down 20 percent since January and some analysts calculate that US Treasury bonds, the benchmark of world borrowing markets, could be having their biggest losing first half of a year since 1788.CredibilityCarstens said the BIS’s own recent warnings about frothy asset prices meant the current correction was “not necessarily a complete surprise”. That there hadn’t been “major market disruptions” so far was also reassuring, he added.Part of the BIS report published already last week said that the recent implosions in the cryptocurrency markets were an indication that long-warned-about dangers of decentralised digital money were now materialising.Those collapses aren’t expected to cause a systemic crisis in the way that bad loans triggered the global financial crash. But Carstens stressed losses would be sizeable and that the opaque nature of the crypto universe fed uncertainty.Returning to the macro economic picture, he added that the BIS didn’t currently expect a period of widespread stagflation to take hold.He also said that though many global central banks and the BIS itself had significantly underestimated how quick global inflation has spiralled over the last six to 12 months, they weren’t about to lose hard-earned credibility overnight.“Yes, you can argue a little bit here about an error of timing of certain actions and the responses of the central banks. But by and large, I think that the central banks have responded forcefully in a very agile fashion,” Carstens said.“My sense is that central banks will prevail at the end of the day, and that would be good for their credibility.” ","The world’s central bank umbrella body, the Bank for International Settlements, has called for interest rates to be raised .The usual remedy of ramping up interest rates is raising the spectre of recession .The BIS thinks an economic soft landing - where rates rise without triggering recessions - is still possible .",https://kathmandupost.com/world/2022/06/26/banking-body-urges-decisive-wave-of-global-rate-hikes-to-stem-inflation,Kathmandu Post,World ,6/26/2022 19:18

699,Blue light effects on skin,"Take a wander down the skincare aisle of any health and beauty retailer and you’ll be met with a bewildering array of creams and sprays, promising to protect you from various threats to your skin.You might have noticed skincare companies claiming their products can protect you from the effects of blue light. If you hadn’t thought about blue light before, you’d be forgiven for worrying about whether you should be concerned. First you need to understand what blue light is.Visible light accounts for 50 percent of the sunlight spectrum and, as the name suggests, it’s the only part of light that can be detected by the human eye. The blue band of this visible spectrum has a particularly high energy level. The longer the wavelength, the less energy it transmits. Blue light has very short, high energy waves.Blue light is all around you. The sun emits blue light. So do fluorescent and incandescent light bulbs, mobile phones, computer screens and flat screen televisions.What are the risks?There is mounting evidence that blue light can have a harmful effect on the skin and eyes and disrupt the circadian rhythm (your internal clock). Typically, studies investigating the impact of sun radiation on the skin have focused on ultraviolet radiation, particularly UVB, which is responsible for sunburn. The most frequently reported effect of blue light exposure is a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), highly reactive chemicals formed from oxygen. Too much ROS can damage your DNA and key enzymes such as those responsible for DNA repair, increasing your risk of cancer.Our research showed blue light can induce pigmentation (tanning) across skin types. While many people consider a deep tan a desirable trait, it is a marker of skin damage and ROS. Other researchers found skin tans from visible light (which includes blue light) had darker pigmentation that lasted longer compared to ultraviolet radiation exposure. Our studies also showed blue light can activate genes associated with inflammation and photoageing (skin damge). Several studies have proved typical sunscreens do not prevent blue and visible light damage.While blue light appears to be less potent than ultraviolet radiation, this may be accounted for by the relatively larger amounts of blue light that reach the Earth. UVR accounts for around 5 percent of solar radiation in the UK at midday in the summer. Blue light makes up around three times more at 15 percent.There are some beneficial effects of blue light. It has been used to treat skin conditions including eczema, it is widely used in photodynamic therapy, which is used to treat a range of skins conditions, from acne to cancer, and it boosts wound healing. But the harmful effects of blue light are likely to outweigh the positives for healthy people.Blue light can damage the skin but it’s less clear which sources of blue light are harmful to humans. The blue light from screens is responsible for a fraction of the blue light doses we get. Research has shown screens from devices can increase ROS production. However, a study by German skincare manufacturer Biersdorf found that an entire week’s worth exposure to blue light from a screen at a distance of 30cm is equivalent to just one minute of midday summer sun in Hamburg, Germany. Another study found blue light from screens were 100 - 1,000 times less intense than blue light from the sun. It also failed to trigger melasma, which causes patches of skin discolouration, in patients who have the condition. It’s true we are spending more time in front of screens than ever before but while screens may cause some damage, it’s insignificant compared with sun exposure.Blue light skincareThe cosmetics industry has started developing a wide range of skincare products that brands claim prevent blue light damage. However, there is no regulated or standardised test to assess a product’s ability to prevent blue light damage. Companies do carry out scientific tests on these products. But they can use any number of assessments in their work. This is very different from the regulations around sunscreen that claim to contain Sun protection factor (SPF).. SPF testing is closely regulated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). All products that claim to contain an SPF undergo an identical testing regime.The lack of regulation for blue light claims makes it impossible for consumers to make informed choices about the level of protection offered and differences between products. This lack of regulation is unlikely to be dangerous for consumers, but the benefit from the products may be limited. Given the evidence around blue light emitted by screens, it’s worth applying scepticism to any claims that a product is needed to prevent damage from your computer screen or phone.Traditional photoprotection products (such as sunscreens) don’t typically protect you from blue light damage. It’s encouraging the skincare industry is trying to address this need. But it is crucial that governments take the next step in the process and develop industry-wide, standardised testing. In the meantime, it is important to remember to limit any exposure to the sun. The use of sunscreens (or any product containing an SPF rating) have been proven to prevent skin cancer and photoageing, and products advertising blue light protection may give an additional benefit.—The ConversationRead the original article here.

698,Promoting white water rafting,"Nepal has drawn global attention from mountain lovers ever since Everest in the Himalaya was found to be the world's tallest mountain in 1856. Another event that brought this small Himalayan country into the global limelight was the successful ascent of the summit by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953. Since then, Nepal has gradually become a popular destination for adventurers and general tourists.Besides mountaineering, some niche adventure tourism activities in Nepal include trekking, rafting, canoeing, kayaking, canyoning, bungee jumping, paragliding, jungle safari and wild game hunting. Rafting on the white-water rivers flowing down from the high-altitude Himalayan glaciers has become a favourite pastime of many passionate men and women, particularly from the West. River rafting has a relatively short history in Nepal. The credit for introducing this adventurous sport on Nepali rivers in the late 1960s goes to a few European and American explorers. The Sun Koshi and Trishuli rivers appealed to them at first. As the commercial potential of river rafting became evident, Mike Yager, an American mountaineer, established Himalayan River Exploration, the first commercial river rafting company in Nepal, in 1976. Yager, an experienced river guide from the United States, trained the first batch of Nepali and American enthusiasts, leading young Nepali men to prepare themselves to become professionally competent river guides. Today, some Nepali river guides are known as the best in the world. As their skills are appreciated internationally, they are often invited to lead and support expeditions in India, Bhutan, China, Japan, Russia, Iceland, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The Nepal Association of Rafting Agencies was established in 1989 as the umbrella organisation for professional entrepreneurship development in river rafting. It currently has over five dozen agencies as registered members.Tourism potentialInternational experts assert that no other country can compete with Nepal in offering some of the wildest and most spectacular rivers for adventurous water sports. The Sun Koshi, Bhote Koshi and Karnali are among the top 10 rivers rated highly appropriate for rafting. Currently, there are 16 significant rivers open for rafting in Nepal. The Nepal Association of Rafting Agencies estimates that roughly 10 percent of Nepal's 6,000 rivers are suitable for rafting.Nepal, as a popular tourist destination, offers fun lovers a variety of experiences in rafting. One can access rivers graded from 1 to 6, the international scale of river difficulty, with 1 being easy and 6 being extreme. People can select a rafting trip for a duration that best suits them. While the Sun Koshi and Karnali provide more extended expeditions of up to 10 days, the Trishuli, Bhote Koshi and Seti are suitable for short adventures of one to three days and offer a smooth class experience. A one-day trip on the Trishuli from Fisling to Mugling is popular among Nepali families interested in rafting. The Centre for Research in Tourism recently conducted a study to assess the feasibility of white water rafting on a particular stretch of the Tama Koshi River. Originating in Tibet, this river flows north to south through Dolakha and Ramechhap districts. I had the privilege to lead the study team comprising several world class Nepali river guides. The study extensively explored the 12-kilometre stretch from Nayapul in Dolakha to Devitar in Ramechhap and recommended its promotion for local employment and income generation. This section of the river and the entire length of 70 kilometres from Nayapul to Khurkot in Sindhuli district is suitable for rafting. However, several activities need to be done by the concerned stakeholders to realise the potential in the explored areas. Some key challenges include physical infrastructure development, local entrepreneurship development, financial capital for operating the businesses, and the availability of a reasonably trained workforce in the local hospitality market. Partnership for promotionWhile there is no contention over the issue that the private sector should lead business in the 21st century, the government's genuine support is expected in physical infrastructure development that includes access to roads and other transportation networks and facilitating the entire process related to the business. The community has a prominent role in conserving all kinds of unique tourism attractions available locally to benefit most from the industry's success. As a subsector of tourism, the rafting business was severely affected by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Operating costs like staff salary, house rent, capital repayment and interest payments were the immediate problems that surfaced. Despite this, the industry cooperated with the government, closing businesses completely for months to check the spread of the Covid-19 virus. This seasonal business, in the winter and spring in Nepal, employs roughly 10,000 persons in roles varying from office manager to field staff. Women constitute approximately 5 percent of the workforce, mainly in office management. A few are rescuers who, as solo riders in kayaking boats, accompany the rafts.One notable characteristic of the Nepali rafting industry is its lack of foreign investment. The entrepreneurs are proud of their ability to invest in this business which can be initiated with around Rs3 million. However, foreign investment does not mean merely capital inflow; it is desirable in Nepal for other reasons such as technology transfer and overseas marketing.Hydropower development has been one of the critical detrimental factors to the growth of rafting. The dams constructed on the Bhote Koshi have checked the growth of rafting and kayaking on some of the world's most promising water sport stretches. Unscientific extraction of sand and boulders is also hampering it severely. Like in many other development-related activities in Nepal, the promotion of white-water rafting lacks inter-organisational coordination and cooperation. ","Nepal has gradually become a popular destination for adventurers and general tourists .Besides mountaineering, some niche adventure tourism activities in Nepal include trekking, rafting, canoeing, kayaking, canyoning, bungee jumping, paragliding, jungle safari and wild game hunting.",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2022/06/25/promoting-white-water-rafting,Kathmandu Post,Columns ,6/25/2022 20:10
697,No legal clarity on how long the House of Representatives can function after election dates are announced,"The Election Commission said on Friday that it has started preparations to hold the federal and provincial elections by the third week of November.Speaking at a meeting of the parliamentary committee on Women and Social Affairs, Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya said that the elections will be held by November 25.Meanwhile, Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajendra Shrestha said the commission has proposed holding the elections in a single phase on November 16, or on November 14 and on November 19 if they are to be held in two phases.“The government will announce the poll date soon,” he said while addressing the municipal assembly of Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Friday. “The federal and provincial elections will be held in the next four or five months.”As per the law, the government announces the poll dates in consultation with the commission.There is, however, one confusion that no one has been able to address. Till when the House of Representatives can function once the election is announced?Since 1990, after the restoration of democracy, the parliament’s term is fixed for five years. However, Nepal’s democracy has been fragile and constitutions over the years—the country has adopted three charters since 1990—have created quite a confusion.Gopal Nath Yogi, secretary at the House of Representatives, said there is no legal clarity.“When a House is prematurely dissolved, poll dates are announced simultaneously. The country then goes to snap polls. However, in case of regular elections, there is no clarity as to how long it can function after election dates are announced,” Yogi told the Post. “It is up to the government when to end the tenure of Parliament.”As per Article 85, the term of the House of Representatives shall be of five years unless dissolved earlier. It, however, doesn’t say whether or not the House can function after the poll dates are announced.Usually, dates are announced 120 days prior to the elections, so as to give ample time to the Election Commission for preparations.A few days ago, the commission made it clear that the current term of the House will be until December 8, clearing the confusion as to when it will complete its five years. The commission said it has taken December 8, 2017 as the date of commencement of the Parliament tenure as per the House of Representatives and Provincial Assembly Elections Acts. It decided to fix December 8 as the commencement date, saying that on this day the winners of both federal and provincial elections under the first-past-the-post category were announced.In 2017, the elections for the House of Representatives and the seven provincial assemblies were held in two phases. The first phase of elections was held on November 26 and the second on December 7.Commission officials say they cannot say what happens with the lower house once the election dates are announced. “We are not in a position to say for how long Parliament can function after the election dates are announced,” Yagya Bhattarai, a joint secretary at the commission, told the Post.In some parliamentary democracies like neighbouring India and the United Kingdom, there are some provisions in place to guide the term of the House.In India, Article 83 (2) of the constitution says unless sooner dissolved, the House of the People or Lok Sabha shall continue for five years from the date appointed for its first meeting and no longer and the expiration of the said period of five years shall operate as dissolution of the House.Since the first meeting of the 16th Lok Sabha was held on June 4, 2014, when members were administered oath, the term of that Lok Sabha was to expire on June 3, 2019. It, however, was dissolved by the Narendra Modi Cabinet on May 24, 2019 because he was set to take the oath as prime minister again after his party won the elections held from April 11 to May 19. This means the Lok Sabha was very much in place when the general election took place.Modi was sworn in as India’s prime minister for a second term on May 30, 2019, a week after he dissolved the Lok Sabha.In the United Kingdom, the general election is guided by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. The Act provides that Parliament is dissolved automatically after five years. Parliament is dissolved automatically 25 working days before a general election. Unless a general election is triggered outside of the five-year period, as per the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the next date of the general election is at five-year interval on the first Thursday of May.If the elections were to be held by November-end, the government has to announce the dates by the end of next month, so as to allow 120 days, preferably, to the Election Commission for preparations. Legal experts said confusion has arisen in Nepal because there is no legal provision. They, however, say the present government has an opportunity to address the confusion for good by ending the tenure once the election dates are announced. “The ongoing House must come to an end once the election dates are announced,” Bipin Adhikari, a professor and former dean of Kathmandu University School of Law, told the Post. “However, as there are crucial bills pending, the government can wait to end the House until they are ratified.”The Parliament has as many as 61 bills including the replacement bills to the ordinances to discuss and endorse. Some of the bills are related to the implementation of federalism and have been in the House for the last four years or so. Adhikari said the government doesn’t need to dissolve the House, it can simply prorogue the ongoing session which automatically means its tenure can end.There’s no guarantee that parties will field new faces in the upcoming elections. Incumbent lawmakers who want to run for yet another term will launch their election campaigns as soon as the dates are announced. “Conducting the election campaigns while also enjoying the pay and perks from the state is not a good practice,” said Adhikari. “It will amount to misuse of the state resource.”Experts on parliamentary affairs say if there is legal confusion, the government must address it so as to set a precedent so that there won’t be similar confusion in the future. According to Daman Nath Dhungana, a former Speaker, the best action will be ending the current term of the House as soon as elections are announced. “It would be illogical to continue the business of the lower house even after the election dates are announced,” said Dhungana.  ","The Election Commission said on Friday that it has started preparations to hold the federal and provincial elections by the third week of November .Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya said that the elections will be held by November 25 .Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajendra Shrestha said the commission has proposed holding the elections in a single phase on November 16, or on November 14 and on November 19 if they are to be held in two phases.",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/26/no-legal-clarity-on-how-long-the-house-of-representatives-can-function-after-election-dates-are-announced,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/26/2022 8:08
696,Chhaupadi practice puts women with disabilities at higher risk,"Kamala Japrei, 28, from Sainapasela village in Bajhang is visually impaired. Her life since her birth has been full of difficulties but the most difficult days began for her when she started menstruating at the age of 14. In most villages of Bajhang, Achham, Doti and Bajura in Sudurpaschim, menstruating girls, women and postpartum mothers are expected to observe Chhaupadi. During every menstruation cycle, women and girls are secluded and banished outside their homes to a makeshift hut or even livestock shed.The five-day to a week banishment is hard on menstruating girls and women but is especially difficult for disabled women like Japrei.Surviving five days in the chhau shed with no help is a jarring experience for Japrei, she says. “It feels like hell. I have to make my way towards the Natesanghu river on my own when my cycle ends,” she said. “I need help walking around. But since I become untouchable during the five days of my menstrual cycle, I have no one to help me.”Japrei stays in a chhau shed close to her house and walks to the river 3km away to bathe and wash her clothes used during her period cycle.Chhau sheds are usually built close to rivers so that girls and women can have easy access to water to clean themselves and their clothes before they are allowed to enter their house after the cycle ends. In villages where there are no rivers close by, girls and women pitch tents in the fields. “I use the same set of clothes all five days because I can’t change without help,” said Japrei. “I count the hours every day when I’m on my period so that I can get out of the chhau shed and clean up.”Basmati Thapa, 35, of Bajura’s Badimalika Municipality cannot walk without the help of her mother. She has no movement in her legs and hands. Her 65-year-old mother drops her off at the chhau shed every month and returns to help her with cleaning, bathing and washing clothes. “My mother is getting old and I feel like a burden to her,” said Thapa. “I cannot rely on her for long now. In her old age, she has to help me. I worry about her as she worries about me.” Chhau sheds are usually small unventilated and windowless huts made of mud or rocks. Many women and girls are forced to spend their days inside the unhygienic cattle sheds during their menstrual cycle. Disabled girls and women in rural areas go through unimaginable pain while menstruating, says Tulsi Hamal, a member of the Disability Welfare Association Bajura.  Basanta Pratap Singh/TKP“Although there are some parents who help their disabled daughter during their menstruation, a majority of disabled girls and women are left to take care of themselves during that time,” said Hamal. “Sexual attacks on disabled girls and women in the chhau sheds are also a major cause for concern. Women with disabilities are subjected to sexual violence when they have to stay away from home during menstruation. They can’t defend themselves and become a victim of sexual crimes, like rape.”According to Hamal, most of the victims suffer in silence because they find no support at home.Jung BK, a disability rights activist in Achham, says that women are already at the receiving end of injustice, and being a disabled woman doubles their chances of being violated. “The practice of Chhaupadi is so harsh that even the disabled who cannot walk are forced to go to chhau sheds. They are more exposed to violence than other women,” BK said.According to the 2019 report of the National Federation of the Disabled-Nepal, 67 percent of women with disabilities are victims of various forms of violence. Violence is common in public and open spaces, schools, public transportation, and within families. Rights activists say harmful traditions such as Chhaupadi in the hilly and mountainous districts of the far west and Karnali region increase the risk of violence and abuse against women.According to a study conducted by the National Human Rights Commission in 2018, at least 15 people have lost their lives while living in chhau sheds since 2005.The government has declared Chhaupadi illegal but the evil practice is still prevalent in many rural villages of the far west. The National Criminal Code stipulates that menstruating girls and women and postpartum mothers should not be discriminated against. If anyone is found guilty of practising Chhaupadi or forcing other women to practice, s/he is liable to up to three months of imprisonment or a fine of up Rs 3,000 or both.Rama Dhakal, vice-president of the National Federation of the Handicapped, says that the practice of Chhaupadi is a curse for all women, but especially for the handicapped.“In the far west and in Karnali, the practice of Chhaupadi is a big problem. Chhaupadi is a curse for even a healthy woman with her own physical agency, so you can imagine the difficulties a woman with disabilities faces when forced out of her house during menstruation,” she said.According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2017, disability is classified into 10 categories, including physical, visual, hearing, hearing impaired, voice and speech, mental or psychosocial, intellectual, haemophilia, autism and multiple disabilities. According to Nepal in Data, 1.7 percent of Nepal’s total population is disabled—37,285 people are completely disabled, 49,077 severely, 66,839 are moderately disabled and 46,289 mildly.

695,ICC satisfied with CAN’s progress,"A delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday said the cricket’s world governing body was totally satisfied with the progress of the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN).ICC deputy chairman Imran Khwaja, ICC Asia finance and operational officer Niteesha Kothari and ICC head of global development William Glenwright—who visited Nepal to conclude Nepal’s ICC readmission—held meetings with Youth and Sports Minister Maheshwor Jung Gahatraj, National Sports Council member secretary Tanka Lal Ghising and Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) president Chatur Bahadur Chand and highlighted overall development strategies undertaken by CAN in the reinstatement of Nepali cricket.The visit, led by Khwaja, comes ten days after the ICC ended its controlled funding of CAN, after Nepal’s cricket governing body fulfilled all reinstatement conditions set by the apex international cricket body.CAN needed to submit its plans, programmes and budget proposal to the ICC in advance which was subject to mandatory approval from the Dubai-based international body to have their fund released.The lift of the controlled funding means the CAN will receive as much funding as any other one-day international associate member and will also be eligible to do their financial transaction independently.Khwaja said that the ending of controlled funding had concluded Nepal’s ICC readmission and the CAN was independent to do its financial transaction.He, however, warned that CAN should create a trustworthy environment.The ICC had suspended CAN in April 2016 citing breach of ICC regulations that prohibit government interference in “free and fair elections”.Nepal was readmitted as ICC member in 2019 following the election of a 17-member central working committee. However, a transition plan for Nepal's full reinstatement was kept in place that also included controlled funding.ICC head of global development William Glenwright said he was happy with the CAN’s progress and added that Nepal had bright prospects in cricket.CAN president Chand said he was grateful towards the efforts of the ICC representatives in the reinstatement of Nepal. “The readmission has added extra energy in the development of Nepali cricket,” he said.

694,Respite for public amid high inflation as fuel prices lowered with cuts on taxes,"Under pressure from several quarters, the government on Saturday decided to slash the prices of petroleum products.Commerce and Supplies Minister Dilendra Prasad Badu said at a press conference on Saturday afternoon that the government has reduced the price of petrol by Rs20 per litre and made diesel cheaper by Rs29 per litre.Nepal Oil Corporation, the state-owned fuel utility, then came up with a revised price list as per which petrol now will cost Rs179 per litre and diesel and kerosene Rs163 per litre.The new decision came into effect from Saturday midnight.Minister Badu said that the government slashed equivalent taxes to enable the NOC to reduce prices of diesel and petrol. The government, however, has not clarified which taxes were slashed, and to what extent. The move to cut the prices follows instructions from the House committee on Friday and a meeting of the coalition partners on Saturday to revise the rates of petroleum products, saying inflation was taking a toll on the general public.The government was instructed to slash various taxes imposed on petroleum products.After the latest hike in prices, petrol cost Rs199 per litre. Diesel and kerosene price had risen to Rs192 per litre. On Sunday night, Nepal Oil had jacked up prices—Rs21 in petrol and Rs27 in diesel and kerosene per litre. This was the highest increment ever made by the oil monopoly.On June 9, the corporation hiked the price of petrol by Rs8 per litre to Rs178 per litre and diesel and kerosene prices by Rs12 per litre to Rs165 per litre. After petrol price hit one rupee short of Rs200, there was a public outcry. With the rise in diesel prices, commodity prices also shot up, making life difficult for the general public.Calls for cutting taxes on fuel grew, with students launching protests and lawmakers taking the government to the task over high taxes imposed on petroleum products.According to Nepal Oil, the government levied Rs65.61 in taxes on every litre of petrol sold at Rs199. It collected Rs49.53 on every litre of diesel sold at Rs192. The government also collects Rs10 as infrastructure tax in each litre of petrol and diesel sold. “With the government deciding to reduce taxes by a certain percentage point, the prices have been reduced,” said Binitmani Upadhyay, deputy director of Nepal Oil Corporation. At the government’s directive, the corporation board took the decision to revise the price.“Prices have been adjusted as per the government decision to reduce taxes,” said Upadhyay. “The Ministry of Finance will decide on which headings taxes will be reduced. At this time, we only know that taxes have been reduced.”The government has been levying tax on 7 different headings on petroleum products. On the purchase of one litre of petrol at Rs131.91 from the Indian Oil Corporation, the government levies Rs25.23 customs tax, Rs4 as road improvement tax, Rs1.50 as pollution tax, Rs10 as infrastructure tax, Rs22.89 as VAT and Rs1.99 for the price stabilization fund.​​“If the government does not reduce tax or price on source, the corporation will face a monthly loss of Rs9.67 billion,” said Upadhyay.The government earned Rs118.82 billion in various taxes levied on fuel in the first 11 months of this fiscal year. The high taxes, however, drew much criticism against the government.A day after the the Industry, Commerce, Labour and Consumer Welfare Protection Committee of Parliament directed the government to slash taxes on petroleum products by half, a meeting of the ruling coalition on Saturday also instructed the government to reduce petroleum prices.When the prices of petroleum products were hiked on June 19, the corporation was facing a monthly loss of Rs4.7 billion, according to the NOC.“We hope that the tax rate will be reduced at source by the government so as to make up for the losses of the corporation while providing relief to the consumer,” said Upadhyay. At Saturday's press conference, Minister Badu said that people have been forced to shell out more while buying petroleum products because of high taxes, stressing the need to reduce taxes. Rising diesel prices have stoked inflation in the country.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the year-on-year consumer price inflation jumped to a staggering 7.87 percent in May, hitting a 69-month high. It was 3.65 percent in May last year.With the reduction in diesel price, Minister Badu requested traders to reduce the price on daily essentials so as to provide relief to consumers immediately. After the latest hike in petroleum prices, the Department of Transport Management had allowed public transport operators to hike fares by 5.3 percent. For cargo carriers along the Tarai and hill routes, the fares have been hiked by 7.7 percent and 6.94 percent, respectively.“Action will be taken if firms or traders are found guilty of charging more,” said Badu. For governments across the world, reducing fuel prices is a tough task. For one, once reduced, it is difficult to increase the price, and second, fuel taxes are the most important revenue sources.But Nepal’s predicament has been growing lately. The government was reluctant to forego the bonanza created by rising oil prices, as it was raising more revenue from the consumers in the form of taxes, just while it was paying more in dollar bills, leading to a reduction in its foreign exchange reserves.In the first 11 months of the fiscal year ended mid-June, Nepal's fuel import bill almost doubled from the previous year. Imports were valued at Rs340 billion, compared to Rs191.18 billion in the same period last year. The rising imports contributed to depletion of foreign exchange. As of the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the gross foreign exchange reserves decreased 21.1 percent to $9.28 billion in mid-May, 2022 from 11.75 billion in mid-July 2021, according to Nepal Rastra Bank.Economists say there was no other way than tax cuts on fuels for a short duration to cool down the rising inflation. “It is an immediate and short-term relief for the consumer as the Indian Oil is likely to send hiked prices. I think it is both profit and loss for the consumer,” said Dipendra Bahadur Kshetry, an economist who is also a former central bank governor.“With tax cuts, it will be difficult for the government to meet the revenue target while in the long-term different development projects could be impacted if this situation of fuel prices continues,” said Kshetry.According to Kshetry, petroleum prices will continue to remain unpredictable until the Russia-Ukraine war continues.“India will not sell petroleum products by bearing losses. So we should consider reducing the consumption for some time,” he said.  He also cautioned about yet another factor.“In principle, it is the right decision to reduce the prices so as to provide relief to the consumer but the impact is not seen in the market immediately,” he said. “The prices in the market go over speculations and traders are unlikely to reduce the prices of commodities immediately arguing that the cost of all goods and services has increased.”According to Nepal Oil Corporation, when petrol price was hiked to Rs199, it was a 56.69 percent rise within a year. Similarly, when diesel price went up to Rs192 per litre, it was a 74.54 percent rise within a year.Brent crude oil is being traded at $113.12 per barrel, as per international media.Namraj Ghimire, director general of the Department of Transport Management, said that transportation fares will be reduced on Sunday accordingly. “As the office is closed today [Saturday], we will make a decision on Sunday by calculating the reduced price of diesel,” he said.As per the auto-pricing mechanism, the government allows transport entrepreneurs to hike fares when oil prices fluctuate by 5 percent. Economist Ram Prasad Gyawali said that the reduction in taxes of petroleum product prices is a welcome step at a time when high inflation was hitting the general public hard.“Petroleum products work as raw material for production and when the prices decline, the cost of production automatically declines, giving much-needed relief to the consumer,” said Gyawali. “Though the government may face losses in terms of revenue, it can compensate for that when things start getting better.”   ",Price of petrol reduced by Rs20 per litre and made diesel cheaper by Rs29 per litre .Decision came into effect from Saturday midnight .Government has not clarified which taxes were slashed .,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/26/respite-for-public-amid-high-inflation-as-fuel-prices-lowered-with-cuts-on-taxes,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/26/2022 7:32
693,Minister Ale commits to stepping down with a letter to party chair,"Minister Prem Bahadur Ale has handed over a written commitment letter to the party chairman saying he is ready to quit anytime the party wants.“Minister Ale handed over a letter to the party chairman expressing his commitment to quit whenever party wants,” said Hemanta Regmi, a personal aide to Ale. “The letter was handed over to the party chair during the party’s meeting.”The CPN (Unified Socialist), a coalition partner in the current Sher Bahadur Deuba government, has been in a crisis after a Standing Committee meeting on June 5 decided to recall four of its ministers, including Ale. The four ministers, however, defied the party diktat, saying the decision at a time when discussions were being held on the budget was uncalled for. The four ministers as well as six other lawmakers on Friday then submitted a memorandum to party chair Madhav Nepal expressing displeasure at the June 5 decision and demanding a meeting of the Parliamentary Party. But on Saturday, Ale and five lawmakers withdrew their demand. During a politburo meeting of the party on Friday, Minister Ale said that he was ready to put in papers within 48 hours.After all the major committees of the party–standing committee, politburo and central committee–endorsed the party’s decision of changing the existing set of ministers–the ministers who were challenging the decision came under extreme pressure to abide by the party’s decision. On Saturday, the Central Committee meeting of the party unanimously decided to endorse the party Secretariat’s June 5 decision to recall four ministers–Ale, Ram Kumari Jhakri, Birodh Khatiwada and Krishna Kumar Shrestha. The party had decided to appoint Jeevan Ram Shrestha as Tourism, Culture and Civil Aviation minister replacing Ale, Metmani Chaudhary as Urban Development minister replacing Jhakri, Sher Bahadur Kunwar as Labour, Employment and Social Security minister replacing Shrestha and promoting existing state minister for Health and Population Bhawani Khapung as full minister for the same ministry replacing Khatiwada and Hira Chandra KC as state minister replacing Khapung. Party chair Nepal said at a meeting of the All Nepal Women’s Association (Socialist) on Sunday that some ministers have already tendered their resignation.“I have their resignations in my pocket and will make them public whenever necessary. Other ministers will also follow the suit,” Nepal said in the meeting. “But our party’s letter is sufficient to change the ministers. Let’s hope ministers will be changed today.” ","Minister Prem Bahadur Ale has handed over a written commitment letter to the party chairman saying he is ready to quit anytime the party wants.The CPN (Unified Socialist), a coalition partner in the current Sher Bahadur Deuba government, has been in a crisis after a Standing Committee meeting on June 5 decided to recall four of its ministers, including Ale.The four ministers, however, defied the party diktat, saying the decision at a time when discussions were being held on the budget was uncalled for.",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/26/minister-ale-commits-to-stepping-down-with-a-letter-to-party-chair,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/26/2022 14:45

""[It was a] catastrophic failure. It was just not ready. Was I ready? No, I was definitely not ready. I was a baby. I was so young and so inexperienced"" confessed Clarke.
Clarke admitted that she was widely criticized for her acting. The New York Times reported that the actor performed like 'an under-age debutante' who was trying too hard to fit the role of a sophisticated grown-up., reported Variety. Other film critics panned her to be miscast in the character.
Meanwhile, the 'Game of Thrones' actor is preparing for her role as Nina in the play 'The Seagull', directed by Anton Chekhov, to be showcased on the West End stage. Although 'The Seagull' was supposed to launch in March 2020, the play got delayed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As Clarke takes to stage yet again for 'The Seagull', she feels it to be '10 times more frightening', reported Variety.
""It's 10 times more frightening because there'll be people wanting to go and say, 'Well she can only act on camera, she clearly can't act on stage,' which is obviously the biggest fear"" hoped the actor.
'The Seagull' is all geared up to run in the Harold Pinter Theatre from June 30 to September 10.",Clarke made her debut Broadway performance with 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' in 2013 .The actor admitted that she was widely criticized for her acting .She is preparing for her role as Nina in the play 'The Seagull',https://www.nepalnews.com/s/entertainment-and-lifestyle/emilia-clarke-recalls-her-catastrophic-failure-in-a-theatre-play,Nepal News,entertainment-and-lifestyle,6/25/2022 11:34

682,Amazon’s Alexa could soon mimic voice of dead relatives,"Amazon’s Alexa might soon replicate the voice of family members - even if they’re dead.
The capability, unveiled at Amazon’s Re:Mars conference in Las Vegas, is in development and would allow the virtual assistant to mimic the voice of a specific person based on a less than a minute of provided recording.
Rohit Prasad, senior vice president and head scientist for Alexa, said at the event Wednesday that the desire behind the feature was to build greater trust in the interactions users have with Alexa by putting more “human attributes of empathy and affect.”
“These attributes have become even more important during the ongoing pandemic when so many of us have lost ones that we love,” Prasad said. “While AI can’t eliminate that pain of loss, it can definitely make their memories last.”
In a video played by Amazon at the event, a young child asks “Alexa, can Grandma finish reading me the Wizard of Oz?” Alexa then acknowledges the request, and switches to another voice mimicking the child’s grandmother. The voice assistant then continues to read the book in that same voice.To create the feature, Prasad said the company had to learn how to make a “high-quality voice” with a shorter recording, opposed to hours of recording in a studio. Amazon did not provide further details about the feature, which is bound to spark more privacy concerns and ethical questions about consent.Amazon’s push comes as competitor Microsoft earlier this week said it was scaling back its synthetic voice offerings and setting stricter guidelines to “ensure the active participation of the speaker” whose voice is recreated. Microsoft said Tuesday it is limiting which customers get to use the service -- while also continuing to highlight acceptable uses such as an interactive Bugs Bunny character at AT&T stores.
“This technology has exciting potential in education, accessibility, and entertainment, and yet it is also easy to imagine how it could be used to inappropriately impersonate speakers and deceive listeners,” said a blog post from Natasha Crampton, who heads Microsoft’s AI ethics division.","The capability, unveiled at Amazon’s Re:Mars conference in Las Vegas, is in development .It would allow the virtual assistant to mimic the voice of a specific person based on a less than a minute of provided recording .Amazon did not provide further details about the feature, which is bound to spark more privacy concerns and ethical questions about consent .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/amazon-s-alexa-could-soon-mimic-voice-of-dead-relatives,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/24/2022 10:16
681,World’s biggest bacterium found in Caribbean mangrove swamp,"Scientists have discovered the world’s largest bacterium in a Caribbean mangrove swamp.
Most bacteria are microscopic, but this one is so big it can be seen with the naked eye.
The thin white filament, approximately the size of a human eyelash, is “by far the largest bacterium known to date,” said Jean-Marie Volland, a marine biologist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and co-author of a paper announcing the discovery Thursday in the journal Science.
Olivier Gros, a co-author and biologist at the University of the French West Indies and Guiana, found the first example of this bacterium — named Thiomargarita magnifica, or “magnificent sulfur pearl” — clinging to sunken mangrove leaves in the archipelago of Guadeloupe in 2009.
But he didn’t immediately know it was a bacterium because of its surprisingly large size -- these bacteria, on average, reach a length of a third of an inch (0.9 centimeters). Only later genetic analysis revealed the organism to be a single bacterial cell.“It’s an amazing discovery,” said Petra Levin, a microbiologist at Washington University in St Louis, who was not involved in the study. “It opens up the question of how many of these giant bacteria are out there — and reminds us we should never, ever underestimate bacteria.”","Scientists have discovered the world’s largest bacterium in a Caribbean mangrove swamp .Most bacteria are microscopic, but this one is so big it can be seen with the naked eye .The thin white filament is approximately the size of a human eyelash .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/world-s-biggest-bacterium-found-in-caribbean-mangrove-swamp,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/24/2022 12:24
680,NASA wraps up moon rocket test; to set launch date after fix,"NASA said Thursday it has finished testing its huge moon rocket and will move it back to the launch pad in late August.
A date for the first flight will be set after a leak that popped up during a dress rehearsal is fixed, the space agency said.
Earlier this week, NASA fueled the 30-story Space Launch System rocket for the first time and pressed ahead with a critical countdown test despite a fuel line leak. Previous attempts were foiled by technical issues.
No one will be on board the debut launch that will hurl the Orion crew capsule atop the rocket to the moon and back. The initial flight will be followed by astronauts in 2024, looping around the moon and back. The third mission would attempt to land astronauts on the moon no earlier than 2025, more than a half-century after NASA’s Apollo moonshots.","A date for the first flight will be set after a leak that popped up during a dress rehearsal is fixed .Earlier this week, NASA fueled the 30-story Space Launch System rocket for the first time .No one will be on board the debut launch that will hurl the Orion crew capsule atop the rocket to the moon and back .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/nasa-wraps-up-moon-rocket-test-to-set-launch-date-after-fix,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/24/2022 17:51
679,Huawei rolls out Freebuds Pro 2 with dual drivers and IP54 resistance,"Huawei on Thursday teased the Freebuds Pro 2 on its Twitter page, and just hours later, the new flagship audio wearables made their debut at a media event in Central and Eastern Europe.
The new TWS earbuds feature dual drivers, triple microphones for 47dB noise cancellation, and ultra-long battery life.
The Hi-Res Dual Sound system is the bestselling feature of the Freebuds Pro 2. It supports the biggest frequency range for Huawei earbuds, going from 14 Hz to 48k Hz. Huawei also has introduced an adaptive equalizer that learns how the user wears the buds and tweaks the audio to sound great in all scenarios, as per GSM Arena.
In terms of Active Noise Cancellation, the Freebuds Pro reduced ambient noise by up to 40dB, with the Pro 2 now claiming a 47dB reduction. This is accomplished via a three-microphone array (up from 2 on the original FreeBuds Pro).
Like most earbuds, Freebuds Pro 2 can pick up external noise and counteract it when making calls. What Huawei improved here is a new deep neural network algorithm that learns and adapts over time. The sound should also feel better, thanks to the partnership with Devialet, GSM Arena reports.
Huawei did not reveal the battery capacity at the launch but promised up to 30 hours of battery life with the case. Playtime on a single charge is said to be 4 hours with ANC on and 6.5 hours with noise cancellation off. The headphones also meet IP54 for water and dust resistance, which the predecessors were not certified for.
The Huawei Freebuds Pro 2 can be found in some markets for the equivalent of 200 euros. Colour choices are Silver Blue, Silver Frost (which is black), and Ceramic White. Huawei usually throws in a gift or two with every purchase from its store, and this time some users can get a Band 7 for free, as per GSM Arena.
Customers would be able to avail of the gift only if they pre-order until July 10, as actual shipments begin on July 11. ","Huawei on Thursday teased the Freebuds Pro 2 on its Twitter page .Just hours later, the new flagship audio wearables made their debut at a media event in Central and Eastern Europe .The new TWS earbuds feature dual drivers, triple microphones for 47dB noise cancellation, and ultra-long battery life .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/huawei-rolls-out-freebuds-pro-2-with-dual-drivers-and-ip54-resistance,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/25/2022 10:52
678,Apple's AirPods Pro 2 to be released soon," Apple's AirPods Pro 2 to be released soon.
According to GSM Arena, a new System-in-Package (SiP) for the H1 chip, which offers adaptive active noise cancelling, is included with the AirPods Pro 2.
Due to ""greater integration and better manufacturing techniques,"" the new SiP offers improved performance and reduced power consumption.
Along with additional capabilities like heart rate tracking and a hearing aid mode of operation, the Find My function has been updated. The casing contains an enhanced rapid charging system and a USB-C port.
As you can see, they resemble both the AirPods 3 and the AirPods Pro in appearance. These blatantly come from the same family. The AirPods Pro 2 stems have the same pressure-sensitive buttons as the first model.
Although it's unclear whether temperature tracking will really be offered, the AirPods Pro 2 may also be able to track temperature via the heart rate sensor.
The new casing, which features a microphone and can relay what it hears to the earphone for sound improvement, works in conjunction with the hearing aid function.
Additionally, the case has a speaker that may play sounds when the Find My feature is activated, making it easier for you to find the case, as reported by GSM Arena.
A combination of specialized high-amplitude drive units and high dynamic range amplifiers, along with automatically adaptable EQ, spatial audio for head tracking, and audio sharing, are reportedly what we can expect in terms of audio. ","According to GSM Arena, a new System-in-Package (SiP) for the H1 chip is included .The new SiP offers improved performance and reduced power consumption .The case contains an enhanced rapid charging system and a USB-C port .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/apple-s-airpods-pro-2-to-be-released-soon,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/25/2022 14:44
677,Automatic machines prepares Japanese traditional sweet dish 'Wagashi',"A food machine is being used to automatically prepare Wagashi, a Japanese traditional sweet dish. It beautifully creates the delicate appearance of the sweet.
Food machine-making competition is growing tough in the course of creating such a level of technology that can give taste similar to traditional cooking.
""The rice goes through here and sushi rice is made here one by one. This is a machine that grabs sushi rice and arranges it as designed by this tablet. It is very difficult for sushi chef to make the same kind of sushi rice when they hold it by hand and our machine is skillful about it, Ryunosuke Kurihara from Suzumo said.
Ryunosuke Kurihara also said that it does not break even if you hold it tightly because each sushi rice contains air. ""We also make a machine that creates melty sushi rice when you put it in your mouth,"" Kurihara said further.
Recently, Japanese rice balls have been sold at stores all over the world. Visitors are amazed at the new technology.
A visitor said: ""I wonder what they think about how it uses the blade very well. I just tried it and it had tomato sauce, but it was not moist, but the rice was crispy and delicious.""
Takashi Fujita, from Shinagawa Machinery Works said that this food machine is not a simple mechanical meal, but a food machine based on the concept of ""fanning"" fried rice.
""It is made by chefs to provide the deliciousness of Chinese restaurants. I studied cooking methods and cooking time, measured them with my watch, and conducted research and development on how long it would take to make the best-fried rice,"" Takashi Fujita said.
""After all, the most difficult thing was to keep rice grains. The structure of the fanning blades has become the most special shape,"" Takashi Fujita added.
The automatic fried rice machine is designed to give the same feeling as traditionally cooked fried rice. It is very important that the temperature of the pot is kept at the same level and the ingredients are mixed properly.","A food machine is being used to automatically prepare Wagashi, a Japanese traditional sweet dish .It beautifully creates the delicate appearance of the sweet .Food machine-making competition is growing tough in the course of creating such a level of technology .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/science-and-technology/automatic-machines-prepares-japanese-traditional-sweet-dish-wagashi,Nepal News,science-and-technology,6/25/2022 17:26

672,European travel runs into pandemic cutbacks,"Got European travel plans this summer? Don’t forget to pack your passport, sunscreen and plenty of patience.
Liz Morgan arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport 4 1/2 hours before her flight to Athens, finding the line for security snaking out of the terminal and into a big tent along a road before doubling back inside the main building.
“There’s elderly people in the queues, there’s kids, babies. No water, no nothing. No signage, no one helping, no toilets,” said Morgan, who is from Australia and had tried to save time Monday by checking in online and taking only a carry-on bag.
People “couldn’t get to the toilet because if you go out of the queue, you lost your spot,” she said.
After two years of pandemic restrictions, travel demand has roared back, but airlines and airports that slashed jobs during the depths of the COVID-19 crisis are struggling to keep up. With the busy summer tourism season underway in Europe, passengers are encountering chaotic scenes at airports, including lengthy delays, canceled flights and headaches over lost luggage.Schiphol, the Netherlands’ busiest airport, is trimming flights, saying there are thousands of airline seats per day above the capacity that security staff can handle. Dutch carrier KLM apologized for stranding passengers there this month.London’s Gatwick and Heathrow airports are asking airlines to cap their flight numbers. Discount carrier easyJet is scrapping thousands of summer flights to avoid last-minute cancellations and in response to caps at Gatwick and Schiphol. North American airlines wrote to Ireland’s transport chief demanding urgent action to tackle “significant delays” at Dublin’s airport.
Nearly 2,000 flights from major continental European airports were cancelled one week this month, with Schiphol accounting for nearly 9%, according to data from aviation consultancy Cirium. A further 376 flights were canceled from U.K. airports, with Heathrow accounting for 28%, Cirium said.
It’s a similar story in the United States, where airlines cancelled thousands of flights over two days last week because of bad weather just as crowds of summer tourists grow.
“In the vast majority of cases, people are traveling,” said Julia Lo Bue-Said, CEO of the Advantage Travel Group, which represents about 350 U.K. travel agents. But airports are suffering from staff shortages, and it’s taking a lot longer to process security clearances for newly hired workers, she said.
“They’re all creating bottlenecks in the system,” and it also means “when things go wrong, that they’re going drastically wrong,” she said.
The Biden administration scrapping COVID-19 tests for people entering the U.S. is giving an extra boost to pent-up demand for transatlantic travel. Bue-Said said travel agents her group represents reported a jump in U.S. bookings after the requirement was dropped this month.
For American travelers to Europe, the dollar strengthening against the euro and the pound is also a factor, because it makes paying for hotels and restaurants more affordable.","After two years of pandemic restrictions, travel demand has roared back .Airlines and airports that slashed jobs during the depths of the COVID-19 crisis are struggling to keep up .With the busy summer tourism season underway in Europe, passengers are encountering chaotic scenes at airports .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/travel-and-tourism/european-travel-runs-into-pandemic-cutbacks,Nepal News,travel-and-tourism,6/23/2022 15:30

670,Molecular factors to treat melanoma skin cancer,"According to a recent study, a group of researchers found important molecular information that could support scientists to develop more effective treatment and strategies to prevent difficult to treat form of melanoma skin cancer.
The findings were published in the journal 'Nature Communications'.
In this new report, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC - James) researchers identify and describe key features of a gene mutation responsible for 15 to 20% of all melanomas.
Using a preclinical laboratory model, the team establishes that the frequency at which a specific NRAS gene mutation occurs in human melanoma is directly related to the ability of that gene mutation to initiate spontaneous melanoma formation.
""This means that properties of the mutant itself - rather than the ease at which that specific gene mutation occurs - is the cause of cancer formation,"" said corresponding author Christin Burd who serves an associate professor of molecular genetics in The Ohio State University College of Arts and Sciences, Department of Molecular Genetics and a member of the OSUCCC - James Molecular Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention Program.
""NRAS-mutant cancers are challenging to treat because effective therapies beyond immunotherapy don't exist yet,"" said Burd. ""Each cancer type seems to prefer a specific 'flavor' of mutant NRAS, and it has not been clear why this is.""
The OSUCCC - James wanted to know what made the melanoma-promoting NRAS mutants different than those that promote other cancer types. Scientists say this knowledge could help investigators pinpoint the early events required for melanoma formation and develop treatments that prevent the disease.
Burd and colleagues report their findings in the June 7, 2022, issue of Nature Communications.
Study design and methods
To conduct this study, OSUCCC - James researchers developed genetically engineered models that would allow them to activate one of nine different NRAS-mutant variations in melanocytes, the pigment cells that form melanoma.
""Amazingly, when we activated these gene mutations only those found in the human disease caused melanoma to develop,"" said Burd. ""Some mutants never led to melanoma, yet we know that they cause leukemia. This finding shows that selection of NRAS mutations is specific to each tumor type and occurs during cancer initiation, rather than in response to a specific mutagenic event like sun exposure.""
Collaborating with Sharon Campbell, a structural biologist at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill, and Debbie Morrison at the National Institutes of Health, Burd's team identified that slight variances in the outward facing structure of NRAS mutants capable of initiating melanoma that made these proteins better able to interact with the signaling pathways that drive melanoma growth.
""Now we will work to target this unique structural feature of the melanoma-inducing NRAS mutants to prevent and/or treat the disease,"" said Burd. ""Our work also demonstrates and confirms what was - until now - only speculation: that minor differences between the RAS mutants determine which 'flavors' can cause a particular cancer. Such a concept could be used to find vulnerabilities in other RAS-driven tumor types.""
To facilitate similar discoveries, the team generated eight new and publicly available genetically engineered mouse models that will serve as an essential toolkit for the entire RAS community. Burd says these models can be used to activate and study the role of NRAS is other relevant cancer types such as colon cancer, leukemia, myeloma, and thyroid cancer. They can also be used to investigate new drugs for these diseases.",Researchers found important molecular information that could support scientists to develop more effective treatment and strategies to prevent melanoma skin cancer .Researchers identify and describe key features of a gene mutation responsible for 15 to 20% of all melanomas .Scientists say this knowledge could help investigators pinpoint the early events required for melanoma formation and develop treatments that prevent the disease .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/molecular-factors-to-treat-melanoma-skin-cancer,Nepal News,health,6/24/2022 13:15

668,Sight problems can increase dementia risk,"According to a new systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies involving 76,373 participants, older adults with untreated sight conditions may be at increased risk of dementia.
The results of the study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Aging and Mental Health, highlight a need for further research to examine the impact of correcting sight problems in older adults - for example, with glasses or cataract surgery - to prevent cognitive problems and dementia.
""This study is among the first to evaluate the association between sight problems and cognitive outcomes in older adults through a comprehensive examination of all available population-based studies in English. Our findings add to the growing evidence that fading eyesight is a risk factor for developing dementia,"" said lead author, Associate Professor Beibei Xu, from the Medical Informatics Center, at Peking University. ""Although the reasons behind this remain unclear, it suggests that diagnosing and treating eye conditions may be beneficial - both to improve a person's quality of life and also to potentially slow down or stop memory loss.""
Nearly one million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the UK - and that number is set to increase over the next few decades as the population ages. By 2050, it is predicted that this figure will have jumped to 1.6 million. The cost of dementia is expected to almost double in the same timeframe, from GBP 25bn today to GBP 47bn in 2050. The disease has a devastating impact on people's lives. As their disease progresses, they will experience greater memory loss and changes to their personality and behaviour. Ultimately, they will become completely dependent on others for their care.
The researchers included 16 studies including 76,373 participants, with five cross-sectional studies and 11 longitudinal studies published before April 2020. From these studies, the authors examined the relationship between visual impairment and cognitive outcomes in older adults. They found that:
People with a sight problem had an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, regardless of whether their visual impairment was self-reported or diagnosed using objective measures.
The likelihood of having a cognitive impairment was 137 per cent higher among people who had a sight problem compared to those who did not.
People who had a sight problem at baseline had a 41 per cent increased risk of developing cognitive impairment and a 44 per cent increased risk of dementia, compared with those who did not.
""Finding ways to prevent or delay the onset of dementia could help reduce its devastating impact on the lives of affected individuals and their families, especially in light of the growing burden of the disease. Identifying modifiable risk factors is the first critical step for developing effective interventions to achieve this goal,"" says Beibei Xu.
He added, ""Our new results highlight the importance of regular eye examinations for older adults, enabling any potential problems with their vision to be spotted and treated early. They also suggest that any self-reported changes to a person's eyesight should not be ignored."" ","Research published in the peer-reviewed journal Aging and Mental Health .Findings add to growing evidence that fading eyesight is a risk factor for dementia .Nearly one million people are estimated to be living with dementia in the UK .By 2050, it is predicted that this figure will have jumped to 1.6 million .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/sight-problems-can-increase-dementia-risk,Nepal News,health,6/25/2022 8:29
667,Women experience different heart disease symptoms than men,"According to a study by the University of Florida, newly identified genes may help explain why women experience different heart disease symptoms than men do, which often leads to misdiagnosing serious problems.
According to University of Florida College of Nursing associate professor Jennifer Dungan, many of the current symptom profiles and lab tests for heart disease do not accurately reflect known differences in women's heart disease. This oversight has led to increased gaps in health care equity.
""Because of this disparity, women are more likely than men to report heart disease symptoms that appear out of the norm, experience delayed treatment for heart disease, and even have undiagnosed heart attacks,"" Dungan said. ""For reasons that remain uncertain, women can experience heart disease differently than men. This can lead to inequities for women that need to be addressed.""
Dungan said cardiac researchers believe that some of these differences in symptoms and outcomes may be due to genetic variation between men and women. She has identified a specific gene she believes may be responsible, named RAP1GAP2.
""RAP1GAP2 is a strong candidate for sex-linked effects on women's heart disease outcomes,"" Dungan said. ""Certain DNA markers in this gene are thought to manage the activity of platelets, colorless blood cells that help our blood clot. This also presents a heart attack risk. An overactive gene could cause too many platelets to respond to the clot, which could block the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle and lead to a heart attack.""
Since RAP1GAP2 was not linked to poor heart outcomes among men in her team's study, she believes this gene may work differently in women. Her team included faculty from UF's colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Public Health and Health Professions. Their findings were recently published in American Heart Journal Plus.
Even less is known about such differences among races and ethnicities. Black women and some Hispanic women are at an even greater risk of poor heart disease outcomes, due to many factors that Dungan believes may include genetics.
Unfortunately, the traditional ways that racial and ethnic groups are studied tends to produce results that are not relevant, Dungan said.
""The goal is not to find biological differences between groups of people. Our goal instead is to find the gene markers most accurately linked to heart disease for all women,"" she said. ""And to do that, we need to consider genetic variation within women, too.""
To discover how the gene may impact cardiac disease risks among women of different backgrounds, Dungan's newest project, supported by a two-year grant from the National Institute on Aging, a division of the National Institutes of Health, aims to find the specific RAP1GAP2 gene markers that most strongly correlate with disease symptoms, heart attacks and death in women from different racial and ethnic groups.
Using health data from 17,000 postmenopausal women, Dungan and her team will use statistical genetics methods to analyze if there is a link between certain DNA markers on RAP1GAP2 and heart disease. Her team will also use genetic ancestry markers rather than arbitrary racial categories to account for natural diversity in our genetic code. According to Dungan, this will assure that her team finds gene markers that reflect all women's heart disease risk, not just for certain groups.
""At the end of the study, if RAP1GAP2 gene markers accurately reflect women's heart symptoms and predict their likelihood of a future heart attack, stroke or death, then those gene markers could help us be more confident in their diagnosis and future prognosis,"" she said. ""Having more accurate biomarkers for women would save lives and improve health equity for all women."" ",Study: Genes may explain why women experience different heart disease symptoms than men do .Researchers believe some of these differences may be due to genetic variation .RAP1GAP2 is a strong candidate for sex-linked effects on women's heart disease outcomes .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/women-experience-different-heart-disease-symptoms-than-men,Nepal News,health,6/25/2022 11:20
666,"Al-Khelaïfi acquitted again, Valcke guilty in FIFA retrial","Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser al-Khelaïfi was acquitted in Switzerland on Friday for a second time in a retrial of alleged wrongdoing linked to former FIFA secretary general Jérôme Valcke.
Al-Khelaïfi was cleared again of a charge of incitement to commit aggravated criminal mismanagement for allowing Valcke to use a vacation home in Sardinia rent free. Prosecutors tried to link the home, bought by a Qatari company in 2013, to Al-Khelaïfi-led broadcaster beIN Media Group getting a renewed World Cup rights deal from FIFA.
Valcke, who was FIFA’s top administrator for eight years until being removed in 2015, was acquitted again of criminal mismanagement and convicted on separate charges not involving Al-Khelaïfi. They relate to taking kickbacks in negotiations for World Cup broadcast rights in Italy and Greece.
The Swiss federal criminal court found Valcke guilty of repeated forgery and passive corruption. He was given a longer suspended sentence — 11 months instead of three — than he received after the original trial in September 2020.Lawyers for Valcke said in a statement he would appeal and “the guilty verdict is therefore in no way final.”
A third defendant, Greek marketing executive Dinos Deris, was convicted of active corruption and given a 10-month suspended sentence after first being acquitted in 2020. He was again cleared of inciting Valcke to mismanagement against FIFA’s interests.The sentences for Valcke and Deris were both suspended for probationary periods of two years.
The retrial was held in March at the Swiss federal criminal court after prosecutors appealed against the original verdicts.
Al-Khelaïfi’s second acquittal was hailed by his legal team as “total vindication.”
“The years of baseless allegations, fictitious charges and constant smears have been proven to be completely and wholly unsubstantiated — twice,” lawyer Marc Bonnant said in a statement.
During a five-year investigation, Al-Khelaïfi, who is also a member of the World Cup host nation’s government, rose in power and status in European soccer.
Despite being a suspect in Swiss criminal proceedings, Al-Khelaïfi was elected in 2019 to join the UEFA executive committee and now leads the influential European Club Association after PSG refused to join the failed Super League project last year.
The prosecution case against Al-Khelaïfi focused on beIN’s renewal of World Cup rights in the Middle East and North Africa with FIFA around the time the Italian villa was bought.
Lawyers for Al-Khelaïfi argued beIN’s deal for the 2026 and 2030 World Cups, said in court to be worth $480 million in total, was good for FIFA.
While often using the vacation home from 2013 to 2015, Valcke also oversaw FIFA-led talks to move the 2022 World Cup in Qatar from June and July to the cooler months of November and December. FIFA was also awaiting, then dealing with the fallout from, its ethics committee’s investigation into the 2018-2022 World Cup bidding contests.
The charges proven against Valcke related to filing three payments totaling 1.25 million euros ($1.32 million) to his personal company’s accounts as loans.However, the three appeal court judges withdrew an order made in 2020 for Valcke to pay FIFA 1.75 million euros ($1.84 million) in restitution.
“Mr. Valcke did not harm FIFA and his full acquittal on the counts of mismanagement has therefore logically been confirmed,” his legal firm, Geneva-based RVMH Attorneys, said in a statement. “Just as logically, the criminal justice system has now rejected FIFA’s civil claims.”
Valcke’s convictions were announced in the same week that former FIFA president Sepp Blatter was on trial in the same Bellinzona courthouse in a separate case. Blatter and former UEFA president Michel Platini faced fraud, forgery and financial misconduct charges.
Verdicts are due on July 8 in that case, which relates to a Blatter-approved FIFA payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2 million) to Platini in 2011.
Blatter and Valcke are still suspects in a separate Swiss criminal proceeding that also involves former FIFA finance director Markus Kattner, That case is about a $1 million FIFA payment to the Trinidad and Tobago soccer federation in 2010.
Al-Khelaïfi has also been under investigation by financial prosecutors in Paris for payments linked to Qatari bids to host the track and field world championships, which were staged in Doha in 2019.","Nasser al-Khelafi was cleared again of a charge of incitement to commit aggravated criminal mismanagement .Prosecutors tried to link the home, bought by a Qatari company in 2013, to Al-Khelafi-led broadcaster beIN Media Group getting a renewed World Cup rights deal from FIFA .Former FIFA secretary general Jérme Valcke was acquitted again of criminal mismanagement and convicted on separate charges not involving Al-Khelafi .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/sports/al-khelaifi-acquitted-again-valcke-guilty-in-fifa-retrial,Nepal News,sports,6/24/2022 18:06
665,Aaron Finch lauds Sri Lanka for their performances,"Following his side's four-wicket win over Sri Lanka in a dead rubber, Australian captain Aaron Finch said that the series was hard-fought and credit the Lankans for their performances in the series.
Alex Carey's unbeaten 45-run knock powered Australia to 4 wicket win over Sri Lanka in the fifth and final ODI here in Colombo on Friday. Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the 5th and final ODI on Friday but lost the series 3-2.
""The series was hard-fought, but credit to Sri Lanka for the way they played, they deserve the win. Most players got starts, but we were not able to get those big partnerships. We got those 40-50 runs partnerships, but not enough. Pleased with the way we performed (today). I would like to thank all the fans, they have been amazing. We have two more Tests remaining, but a few of us (those not a part of the Test series) are leaving tomorrow, a big thanks to the crowd,"" said Finch in a post-match conference.
Coming to the match, electing to bat after winning the toss, Sri Lanka got off to a bad start.
Hosts lost three wickets for just 34 runs in 8.4 overs. Even after this, there was a flurry of wickets and the score reached 7 wickets for 62 runs and then 8 wickets for 85 runs.
Sri Lankan batters Charith Asalanaka and Kusal Mendis then tried to steady the team, but a miscommunication between the batters saw Aslanaka (14) run out.
After sending back half of the side to the pavilion at the score of 56, Australia's spinners kept the batters in check during the middle overs. Matthew Kunnehman removed both skipper Dasun Shanaka and Dunith Wellalage in the same over to pile on the hosts' misery.
However, Chamika Karunaratne fought courageously with a knock of 75 and stitched together a 58-run ninth-wicket partnership with debutant Pramod Madushan. The lower-order resistance helped Sri Lanka recover and finish their innings at 160.
Defending the small total, Sri Lankan spinners got the team off to a great start. Maheesh Theekshana dismissed Aaron Finch for a duck. In the following over, young left-arm spinner Wellalage dismissed David Warner on 10, who smashed a couple of boundaries in the first over.
Theekshana with his tight lines resumed to upset the batters and removed Josh Inglish on 5 to reduce Australia to 19/3.
A fine debut for debutant Madushan continued when he bagged the wicket of Mitchell Marsh for 24.
Time was not a factor for Australia in their chase and Alex Carey and Cameron Green kept their calm with a 43-run partnership that saw the visitors across the line.
Carey top-scored in the innings with a solid 45*, with Green finishing the job with his side's first maximum to end on 25*.
The win couldn't rescue the series for Australia, but regained some pride, with the ODI series ending 3-2 to Sri Lanka. ",Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the 5th and final ODI on Friday .Aaron Finch's side won the series 3-2 .Alex Carey's unbeaten 45-run knock powered Australia to victory .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/sports/aaron-finch-lauds-sri-lanka-for-their-performances,Nepal News,sports,6/25/2022 12:41

663,Nottingham Forest signs Taiwo Awoniyi from Union Berlin,"Nottingham Forest has signed forward Taiwo Awoniyi after paying a club-record transfer fee to Union Berlin, making the Nigerian its first international signing since returning to the Premier League.
The 24-year-old Awoniyi signed a five-year contract after Forest paid the Bundesliga club a fee reported to be around 17 million pounds ($21 million). Forest announced Saturday it was a record fee but didn’t specify the amount.
Awoniyi, who had joined Liverpool as a teenager before going out on loan, scored 20 goals in 43 games for Union last season.
“It’s always been my dream to play in the Premier League and having spoken to (manager) Steve Cooper about our ambitions and looking at Forest, with its great history, it’s a club that I want to be part of,” Awoniyi said of his move to the City Ground.
Awoniyi, who made his Nigeria debut last year, had joined Union on loan during the 2020-21 season and made the move permanent last July.
“He’s a player who we really believe in and we look forward to him going on to fulfill his potential and become a top Premier League striker with Nottingham Forest,” Cooper said.",Nottingham Forest has signed forward Taiwo Awoniyi from Union Berlin .Forest paid a club-record transfer fee for the 24-year-old Nigerian .Awoniyi is Forest's first international signing since returning to the Premier League .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/sports/nottingham-forest-signs-taiwo-awoniyi-from-union-berlin,Nepal News,sports,6/25/2022 16:52
662,"Overton misses out on century, England gets lead in 3rd test","Jamie Overton missed out on a dream hundred in his debut test match but Jonny Bairstow’s masterful 162 provided England an edge over New Zealand in the third and final test on Saturday.
Overton, who made 97, and Bairstow’s record-breaking seventh wicket stand of 241 lifted England from a precarious 55-6 to 360 all out before the hosts got bowled out before lunch on the third day.
It gave England a lead of 31 runs after New Zealand, already trailing in the series 2-0, was dismissed for 329.
New Zealand opening batters Tim Latham (13) and Will Young (0 not out) survived the five overs before lunch to reach 13-0, still trailing by 18 runs.
Overton was overcautious against the pace after resuming on 89 overnight before square driving Trent Boult for his first boundary of the day.
Bairstow, 130 overnight, raised England’s second-fastest 150 in a test match off 144 balls when he drove Neil Wagner through covers for two runs and was duly applauded by his hometown supporters at Headingley.Boult, who had sliced through England’s top order, finally broke the stand when Overton edged a low catch in the slips after the left-arm fast bowler changed the line by coming round the wicket. Overton’s brilliant counter-attack came off 136 balls and featured 13 fours and two sixes. Boult finished with 4-104.Stuart Broad then played a superb cameo of 42 off 36 balls that included sixes against both Boult and Wagner before Tim Southee (3-100) hit the top of the stumps and had the left-hander clean bowled.
Bairstow’s second successive blistering knock of the series finally ended when he came down the wicket against the spin of Michael Bracewell and Boult took a smart catch at long-off. Boult slid forward and grabbed the ball inches above the ground as Bairstow got a thunderous applause from his supporters while walking back to the dressing room.
Bairstow’s blistering knock off 157 balls featured 24 fours as he decimated both spin and pace of New Zealand and had given England a chance to clean sweep the three-match series.","Jamie Overton missed out on a dream hundred in his debut test match .Jonny Bairstow’s masterful 162 provided England an edge over New Zealand .Overton and Bairstow’s record-breaking seventh wicket stand of 241 lifted England from a precarious 55-6 to 360 all out .It gave England a lead of 31 runs after New Zealand, already trailing in the series 2-0, was dismissed for 329 .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/sports/overton-misses-out-on-century-england-gets-lead-in-3rd-test,Nepal News,sports,6/25/2022 19:01
661,Russia again cuts natural gas exports to European countries,"Russia reduced natural gas to Europe again Friday, including cutting flows by half to Italy and Slovakia and completely to France, as countries have worked to ease their dependence on Russian supplies amid the war in Ukraine.
It marks the third day of significant reductions to the fuel that powers industry and generates electricity in Europe, which also have hit Germany and Austria. It has further spiked already-high energy prices that are driving record inflation in the European Union.
Russia has blamed a technical problem for the cuts to the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline serving Germany and France, saying equipment being refurbished in Canada was stuck there because of Western sanctions. Leaders in Germany and Italy called the reductions a political move, and it’s escalated the energy tensions in Europe, following Russia’s previous cutoff of natural gas to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that the reductions are “blackmail (against) both individual countries and Europe as a whole.”Russia told Slovakia’s state-controlled gas company SPP that it would reduce deliveries to the country by 50%, SPP director Richard Prokypcak told a conference in Bratislava. The reason for the reduction has not been made clear.
Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom told Italian gas company Eni on the same day that it would supply only 50% of the amount of gas requested for Friday, reducing the flow to one of Europe’s biggest importers of Russian gas for a third day.Gazprom reduced by 15% Italy’s requested delivery on Wednesday. The ANSA news agency reported the Russian company dropped it by 35% on Thursday. Italy gets 40% of its gas from Russia but has been working to find alternative sources in countries like Algeria.
And France is no longer receiving any natural gas from Russia. The French gas network operator GRTGaz said Russian supplies via Germany came to a halt Wednesday, after dropping by 60% over the first five months of the year.
The operator said Friday that despite the halt in Russian supplies, no disruptions to gas supplies are expected this summer, in part thanks to more shipments via Spain. France normally gets about 17% of its natural gas from Russia, but overall gas is a relatively small part of France’s energy mix, at about 16%.
The cut in supplies to France was “a consequence of the already-known reduction” of gas supplies via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, German Economy Ministry spokesman Stephan Gabriel Haufe said. He didn’t have further details of specific reasons for the cut.
Russia has said Canadian sanctions prevented German partner Siemens Energy from delivering equipment that had been sent there to be overhauled. The German government said maintenance shouldn’t have been an issue until the fall and the Russian decision was meant sow uncertainty and push up prices.
“Both we and Germany and others maintain it’s a lie, there’s a political use of gas” by Russia, Italian Premier Mario Draghi said in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, on Thursday.
In Slovakia, Prokypcak downplayed the impact of the cuts despite “facing a real risk (the supplies from Russia) will halt completely,” the CTK news agency quoted him as saying.In the previous days, the cuts reached 10% on Wednesday and 34% on Thursday. To diversify supplies, Slovakia has recently struck a deal with Norway to receive gas from the North Sea through Germany and also liquefied gas from other countries.
Economy Minister Richard Sulik said the new deals would reduce his country’s dependence on Russian gas by 65%. Before the deals, Slovakia received 85% of its gas from Russia.
Slovakia has about one-third of the country’s one-year consumption in its gas storages and was planning to have enough gas for the winter season stored by July 10.
Austrian oil and gas company OMV said Thursday that Gazprom had informed it of a reduction in supplies but didn’t specify by how much.
The European Union is trying to reduce gas imports from Russia by two-thirds by the end of the year and has used imported liquid gas from the United States to start making up that gap. But an explosion and fire at a key U.S. export facility in Freeport, Texas, took one-fifth of the country’s gas export capacity offline and underlined concerns about the fragility of Europe’s gas supplies.
Short-term natural gas prices remained elevated Friday, at 126 euros per megawatt for month-ahead gas futures. That is up some 50% from Monday.Gas prices had fallen with the end of the winter heating season, offering some relief to European utilities scrambling to refill underground storage to have enough to get through next winter.","Russia reduces natural gas to Europe again Friday, including cutting flows by half to Italy and Slovakia and completely to France .It marks the third day of significant reductions to the fuel that powers industry and generates electricity in Europe .Russia has blamed a technical problem for the cuts to the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline serving Germany and France .Leaders in Germany and Italy called the reductions a political move, and it’s escalated the energy tensions in Europe .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/business/russia-again-cuts-natural-gas-exports-to-european-countries,Nepal News,business,6/18/2022 10:19
660,Germany to limit use of gas for electricity production,"Germany’s economy minister said Sunday that the country will limit the use of natural gas for electricity production amid concerns about possible shortages caused by a cut in supplies from Russia.
Economy Minister Robert Habeck said that Germany will try to compensate for the move by increasing the burning of coal, a more polluting fossil fuel.
“That’s bitter, but it’s simply necessary for this situation to lower gas usage,” said Habeck, a member of the environmentalist Green party.
Russian gas company Gazprom announced last week that it was sharply reducing supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for technical reasons, but which Habeck said appeared to be politically motivated.
Germany, which has long relied heavily on energy imports from Russia, began significantly scaling back its imports because of the war in Ukraine.
The government has nevertheless insisted that Russian gas will be needed for a while until alternative sources of energy, such as LNG brought in by ship, are available. Over the past months, the German government has taken measures to fill gas storage facilities to 90% capacity by November to ensure enough gas is available as a heating fuel through the winter.Habeck said storage facilities — currently at 56.7% capacity — were still able to make up the shortfall from Russia with purchases from elsewhere, but nevertheless described the situation as “serious” and said further measures may be necessary.
The German government recently called on citizens to cut back their energy use in light of the tense supply situation.
“It’s obvious that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s strategy is to unsettle us by driving up the price and dividing us,” Habeck said. “We won’t let that happen.”","Economy Minister Robert Habeck said that Germany will try to compensate for the move by increasing the burning of coal .Russian gas company Gazprom announced last week that it was sharply reducing supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline .Germany, which has long relied heavily on energy imports from Russia, began significantly scaling back its imports because of the war in Ukraine .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/business/germany-to-limit-use-of-gas-for-electricity-production,Nepal News,business,6/20/2022 10:02
658,Price of gas all across the globe,"At a gas station near the Cologne, Germany, airport, Bernd Mueller watches the digits quickly climb on the pump: 22 euros ($23), 23 euros, 24 euros. The numbers showing how much gasoline he’s getting rise, too. But much more slowly. Painfully slowly.
“I’m getting rid of my car this October, November,” said Mueller, 80. “I’m retired, and then there’s gas and all that. At some point, you’ve got to scale back.”
Across the globe, drivers like Mueller are rethinking their habits and personal finances amid skyrocketing prices for gasoline and diesel, fueled by Russia’s war in Ukraine and the global rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. Energy prices are a key driver of inflation that is rising worldwide and making the cost of living more expensive.
A motorcycle taxi driver in Vietnam turns off his ride-hailing app rather than burn precious fuel during rush-hour backups. A French family scales back ambitions for an August vacation. A graphic designer in California factors the gas price into the bill for a night out. A mom in Rome, figuring the cost of driving her son to camp, mentally crosses off a pizza night.
Decisions across the world’s economy are as varied as the consumers and countries themselves: Walk more. Dust off that bicycle. Take the subway, the train or the bus. Use a lighter touch on the gas pedal to save fuel. Review that road trip — is it worth it? Or perhaps even go carless.For the untold millions who don’t have access to adequate public transportation or otherwise can’t forgo their car, the solution is to grit their teeth and pay while cutting costs elsewhere.Nguyen Trong Tuyen, a motorcycle taxi driver working for the Grab online ride-hailing service in Hanoi, Vietnam, said he’s been simply switching off the app during rush hour.
“If I get stuck in a traffic jam, the ride fee won’t cover the gasoline cost for the trip,” he said.
Many drivers have been halting their services like Tuyen, making it difficult for customers to book rides.
In Manila, Ronald Sibeyee used to burn 900 pesos ($16.83) worth of diesel a day to run his jeepney, a colorfully decorated vehicle popular for public transportation in the Philippines that evolved from US military jeeps left behind after World War II. Now, it’s as much as 2,200 pesos ($41.40).
“That should have been our income already. Now there’s nothing, or whatever is left,” he said. His income has fallen about 40% due to the fuel price hikes.
Gasoline and diesel prices are a complex equation of the cost of crude oil, taxes, the purchasing power and wealth of individual countries, government subsidies where they exist, and the cut taken by middlemen such as refineries. Oil is priced in dollars, so if a country is an energy importer, the exchange rate plays a role — the recently weaker euro has helped push up gasoline prices in Europe.
And there’s often geopolitical factors, such as the war in Ukraine. Buyers shunning Russian barrels and Western plans to ban the country’s oil have jolted energy markets already facing tight supplies from the rapid pandemic rebound.
There’s a global oil price — around $110 a barrel — but no global pump price due to taxes and other factors. In Hong Kong and Norway, you can pay more than $10 per gallon. In Germany, it can be around $7.50 per gallon, and in France, about $8. While lower fuel taxes mean the US average for a gallon of gas is somewhat cheaper at $5, it’s still the first time the price has been that high.People in poorer countries quickly feel the stress from higher energy prices, but Europeans and Americans also are being squeezed. Americans have less access to public transport, and even Europe’s transit networks don’t reach everyone, particularly those in the countryside.

Others are doing what they can to cut back. Letizia Cecinelli, filling her car at a Rome gas station, said she was biking and trying to reduce car trips “where possible.”
“But if I have a kid and I have to take him to camp? I have to do it by cutting out an extra pizza,” she said.
Pump prices can be political dynamite. US President Joe Biden has pushed for Saudi Arabia to pump more oil to help bring down gas prices, deciding to travel to the kingdom next month after the Saudi-led OPEC+ alliance decided to boost production. The U.S. and other countries also have released oil from their strategic reserves, which helps but isn’t decisive.
Several countries have fuel price caps, including Hungary, where the discount doesn’t apply to foreign license plates. In Germany, the government cut taxes by 35 euro cents a liter on gasoline and 17 cents on diesel, but prices soon began to rise again.Germany also has introduced a discounted 9-euro monthly ticket for public transportation, which led to crowded stations and trains on a recent holiday weekend. But the program only lasts for three months and is of little use to people in the countryside if there’s no train station nearby.
In fact, people are pumping just as much gas as they did before the pandemic, according to Germany’s gas station association.
“People are filling up just as much as before — they’re grumbling but they’re accepting it,” group spokesman Herbert Rabl said.
Is there any relief in sight? A lot depends on how the war in Ukraine affects global oil markets. Analysts say some Russian oil is almost certain to be lost to markets because the European Union, Russia’s biggest and closest customer, has vowed to end most purchases from Moscow within six months.
Meanwhile, India and China are buying more Russian oil. Europe will have to get its supply from somewhere else, such as Middle Eastern exporters. But OPEC+, which includes Russia, has been failing to meet its production targets.For many, spending on things like nights out and, in Europe, the near-religious devotion to extended late summer vacations, are on the cutting table.
Isabelle Bruno, a teacher in the Paris suburbs, now takes the bus to the train station instead of making the 10-minute drive.
“My husband and I are really worried about the holidays because we used to drive our car really often while visiting our family in southern France,” she said. “We will now pay attention to train tickets and use our car only for short rides.”
Leo Theus, a graphic designer from the San Francisco Bay Area city of Hayward, has to be “strategic” in budgeting gas as he heads to meet clients — he might not fill the tank all the way. Gas prices in California are the highest in the U.S., reaching close to $7 per gallon in some parts of the state.
When it comes to going to a club or bar after work, “you’ve got to think about gas now, you got to decide, is it really worth it to go out there or not?” Theus said.","Across the globe, drivers are rethinking their habits and personal finances amid skyrocketing prices for gasoline and diesel .Energy prices are a key driver of inflation that is rising worldwide and making the cost of living more expensive .Decisions across the world’s economy are as varied as the consumers and countries themselves .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/business/price-of-gas-all-across-the-globe,Nepal News,business,6/20/2022 13:26
657,Toyota recalls electric car for faulty wheel that may detach,"Toyota is recalling 2,700 bZ4X crossover vehicles globally for wheel bolts that could become loose, in a major setback for the Japanese automaker’s ambitions to roll out electric cars.
Toyota Motor Corp. said Friday the cause is still under investigation, but the whole wheel could come off, risking a crash.
“Until the remedy is available, no one should drive these vehicles,” the company said in a statement.
Among the vehicles subject to the latest recall, about 2,200 were destined for Europe, 270 for North America, 112 for Japan, and 60 for the rest of Asia, according to Toyota. They were produced between March and June.
The bZ4X, which went on sale about two months ago, is a key model in Toyota’s plans to strengthen its electric lineup.
Toyota is planning to have 30 EV models by 2030, selling 3.5 million electric vehicles globally that year. Toyota is also investing 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) in battery research and development to achieve such goals.The “bz” in the recalled model’s name, as well as others in the works, stands for a “beyond zero” series, including sport-utility vehicles of all sizes, pickup trucks and sportscars, according to Toyota.
The maker of the Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models has been seen by some critics as a straggler in pushing electric vehicles, partly because it has been so bullish, and successful, in other green technology, such as hybrids and fuel cells, as well as efficient gas engines.Demand for electric cars is expected to continue growing, especially with gas prices soaring recently, amid worries about inflation and the war in Ukraine, and as people around the world become more conscious about climate change and the environment.","Toyota is recalling 2,700 bZ4X crossover vehicles globally for wheel bolts that could become loose .The bZ4X, which went on sale about two months ago, is a key model in Toyota’s plans to strengthen its electric lineup .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/business/toyota-recalls-electric-car-for-faulty-wheel-that-may-detach,Nepal News,business,6/24/2022 17:47
656,Japan leads in semiconductors and electronic technology,"Japanese electronic parts companies have the technology to make various electronic substrates. This electronic substrate for the electric product is required to be shaped, miniature as it is applicable to multiple uses.
""It is a technology called jet dispenser, which is used to release liquid. It's our favourite technology and we've developed a jet dispenser that can be applied at a high speed of 500 shots and 600 shots per second. This machine is a device that attaches two heads as a fully automatic device for high-speed releasing. Precise and micro technology is very difficult. Japan has a great deal of experience in manufacturing technology such as semiconductors and electronic components,"" said Toshihiro Momose of Musashi Engineering.
The foundation of semiconductors and electronic substrates is replaced by a variety of materials.
The technology to attach to cloth and film was realized by changing the temperature at the time of installation.
Asserting that the technology to use various sensors has changed, Director and CTO, Connectec Japan, Nozomi Shimoishizaka said, ""It is changing from the old hard type and sturdy sensor board to a small and very weak sensor now.""
""In our company, we are developing technology which enables low temperature attaching. And, we aim to expand the use of sensors and boards that were not installed in the past,"" he added.
For electric vehicle technology, mass production of the electronic substrate is required and Robot Technology has enabled a fully automated line in the manufacture of an electronic substrate, which has many processes.
Moreover, a Fuji official, Daisuke Kato stated ""Solving the subject to maximize production line, we have the concept to produce continuously working line,"" saying further that in order to produce an automatic line alternative to the human worker, it is necessary to work repeatedly in safe and with accuracy.

655,Egypt’s president holds talks with visiting Qatari emir," President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt held talks Saturday with Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who visited Cairo for the first time in years.
The talks focused on ties between the two nations and a set of other regional and global topics, according to a brief statement from the Egyptian presidency. It did not provide further details.
Al Thani arrived at the Itihadiya presidential palace in Cairo for talks with el-Sissi. Both leaders inspected an honor guard and bands played the national anthems of Egypt and Qatar, a livestream of the welcoming ceremony posted by the Egyptian presidency showed.
Egypt’s state-run al-Ahram daily reported that the talks aim at ensuring the “full normalization” of ties between the two nations after resuming their relations early in 2021.
Citing an unnamed source, the newspaper said the two countries will sign agreements that would include Qatari investments in Egypt’s battered economy.During the visit, an Egyptian-Qatari business council will meet with the aim of improving trade and investments between the countries. Qatar announced in March the investment of $5 billion in Egypt’s economy, which was hit badly by the repercussions of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Al Thani landed in Cairo late Friday and was received by el-Sissi at the airport where they greeted each other with a handshake and cheek kisses on the tarmac.
The visit, unthinkable just a few years ago, and the warm welcome showed the rapid improvement of ties between the two nations since the end of a boycott of Doha by four Arab states, including Egypt.
It came ahead of President Joe Biden’s anticipated trip to the Middle East next month. Both el-Sissi and Al Thani will attend a Saudi Arabia-hosted summit with the American president. The summit will include the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Iraq and Egypt.
Egypt’s ties with Qatar deteriorated in 2013 when el-Sissi, as defense minister, led the military’s overthrow of the Islamist President Mohamed Morsi after his short-lived divisive rule. Morsi, who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood, was backed by Qatar.
In 2017, Egypt joined Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in a boycott of Qatar in an effort to force Doha to change its policies.
The rift finally ended in 2021, when Qatar signed a declaration with the four to normalize relations. Since then, ties have improved, and top officials have exchanged visits.
The Egyptian president has since met twice with the emir of Qatar.","Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, visited Cairo for the first time in years .Qatar announced in March the investment of $5 billion in Egypt’s economy .Egypt’s ties with Qatar deteriorated in 2013 when el-Sissi, as defense minister, led the military’s overthrow of the Islamist President Mohamed Morsi .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/global/egypt-s-president-holds-talks-with-visiting-qatari-emir,Nepal News,global,6/25/2022 17:19
654,Conspiracies were hatched to tarnish my family's name: Sheikh Hasina,"Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday inaugurated the landmark Padma bridge which is being termed the pride of the country and said that conspiracies were hatched to tarnish the name of her family.
After forming the government in 2009, PM Hasina faced a setback when the World Bank cancelled a USD 1.2 billion loan on grounds of corruption and cancelled the loan for the Padma bridge.
Although a Canadian court later dismissed the allegation, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) also completely dismantled the project at a time when Hasina's grip on power was weak.
""Many conspiracies, false allegations of corruption as well defamation by the World Bank and its companions posed challenges to the project. The name of my family and officials were tarnished by conspirators,"" she said.
The Bangladesh prime minister pointed out that the international courts ruled in her favour against those allegations that were ""grotesquely false."" She further said that these allegations were carried out only to challenge the country's independent position.
""I have no complaints against anyone, but I reckon those who opposed the Padma Bridge construction plan and called it a 'pipe dream', lack self-confidence. I hope this bridge will boost their confidence,"" she remarked.
Hasina said that the Padma bridge is the source of hope, courage and friendly warm relations of the people of the two banks of the people in the region.
""It is a monument of pride; it is a symbol of our dignity, capacity and emotion. It is also a symbol of our passion, confidence, creativity as well as courage,"" she added.
The Bangladesh PM thanked the people of the banks of the Padma River for giving their land for the bridge.
""Special thanks to the people of the banks of the Padma River, who gave away their ancestral lands for the Bridge without a second thought. In return, we compensated and rehabilitated them, but their sacrifice has no price that we could repay in monetary value,"" she added.
""The world looks astonishingly. Well done! What we have done, Bangladesh! Damaged, shattered, yet will not back down!"" she said.
The Padma multipurpose bridge is ranked 122nd longest in the world. The main bridge is 6.15 kilometres long, while the railway viaduct is 0.532 kilometres long.
The bridge stretches for a total of 10.642 kilometres with 41 spans attached to 42 pillars. The distance between pillars is 150 meters with a pilling of 128 meters deep, which is the deepest pilling in the world. The construction of the 6.15 km long bridge began in 2015, and the last span was built in December 2021.",Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina on Saturday inaugurated the landmark Padma bridge .She said that conspiracies were hatched to tarnish the name of her family .World Bank cancelled a USD 1.2 billion loan on grounds of corruption .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/global/conspiracies-were-hatched-to-tarnish-my-family-s-name-sheikh-hasina,Nepal News,global,6/25/2022 17:39
653,"Iraqi PM to head to Saudi Arabia, Iran for new dialogue"," Iraq’s caretaker prime minister is set to fly to Saudi Arabia, followed by Iran, carrying a new initiative aimed at renewing talks between the two regional arch foes, an official said Saturday.
The official said Mustafa al-Kadhimi was scheduled to travel to Riyadh later in the day for meetings with Saudi officials. He will then travel to Tehran on Sunday.
Al-Kadhimi’s visit seeks to open new avenues that would reactivate Baghdad-mediated dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Iran, according to the official, who is privy to the Iran-Saudi dialogue track. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to divulge the information to the press.
The talks aimed at defusing yearslong tensions between the regional foes began quietly in Iraq’s capital in 2021 as Saudi Arabia sought a way to end its disastrous war against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The conflict has spawned one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters and brought bombs from rebel drones and missiles raining down on Saudi airports and oil facilities.A fifth and last round of talks was held in Baghdad in April before they were suspended again amid soaring Middle East tensions.Iran, the largest Shiite Muslim country in the world, and Sunni powerhouse Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties in 2016 after Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.

652,Strike snarls UK trains for a third day,"Train stations were all but deserted across Britain on Saturday, as the third day of a national strike snarled the weekend plans of millions.
Train companies said only a fifth of passenger services would run, as about 40,000 cleaners, signalers, maintenance workers and station staff walked off the job in Britain’s biggest and most disruptive railway strike for 30 years.
The same workers held 24-hour strikes on Tuesday and Thursday in a dispute over jobs, pay and working conditions.
The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union is seeking a substantial pay raise as workers face a cost-of-living squeeze amid four decade-high inflation rates. Train companies, meanwhile, are seeking to cut costs and staffing after two years in which emergency government funding kept them afloat during the pandemic.
Union General Secretary Mick Lynch said rail workers would not accept “being thrown on the scrapheap after being praised as heroes during COVID,” and warned there could be more strikes over the summer.
“We won’t hesitate to use more industrial action if we can’t reach an agreement or if the companies carry though their threats to make people redundant,” he told Sky News.
The Conservative government insists it will not get involved in the dispute pitting the union against 13 privately owned train-operating companies and the government-owned National Rail infrastructure firm.But the union accuses the government of scuttling negotiations by preventing employers from improving on the 3% pay raise on the table so far. Britain’s inflation rate hit 9.1% in May, as Russia’s war in Ukraine squeezes supplies of energy and food staples while post-pandemic consumer demand soars.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said rail passenger numbers had only returned to 75% of pre-pandemic levels and there needed to be “reform and improvement in the way the railways work, and modernization.”
He has also warned that big pay raises would spark a wage-price spiral driving inflation even higher.
Unions have told the country to brace for more as workers face the worst cost-of-living squeeze in more than a generation. British Airways workers at Heathrow Airport voted to strike over the summer vacation season, lawyers are planning a walkout starting next week, and unions representing teachers and postal workers plan to consult their members about possible action.","About 40,000 cleaners, signalers, maintenance workers and station staff walked off the job in Britain’s biggest and most disruptive railway strike for 30 years .The Rail, Maritime and Transport Union is seeking a substantial pay raise as workers face a cost-of-living squeeze amid four decade-high inflation rates .Train companies are seeking to cut costs and staffing after two years in which emergency government funding kept them afloat during the pandemic .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/global/strike-snarls-uk-trains-for-a-third-day,Nepal News,global,6/25/2022 19:08
651,Cement carbon dioxide emissions quietly double in 20 years,"Heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from making cement, a less talked about but the major source of carbon pollution, have doubled in the last 20 years, new global data shows.
In 2021, worldwide emissions from making cement for buildings, roads and other infrastructure hit nearly 2.9 billion tons (2.6 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide, which is more than 7% of the global carbon emissions, according to emissions scientist Robbie Andrew of Norway’s CICERO Center for International Climate Research and the Global Carbon Project. Twenty years ago, in 2002, cement emissions were some 1.4 billion tons (1.2 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide.
Driven by China, global cement emissions globally have more than tripled since 1992, recently growing at a rate of 2.6% a year. It’s not just that more cement is being made and used. At a time when all industries are supposed to be cleaning up their processes, cement has actually been going in the opposite direction. The carbon intensity of cement — how much pollution is emitted per ton — has increased 9.3% from 2015 to 2020, primarily because of China, according to the International Energy Agency.
“Cement emissions have grown faster than most other carbon sources,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who leads the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that track worldwide climate pollution and publish their work in peer-reviewed journals. “Cement emissions were also unusual in that they never dropped during COVID. They didn’t grow as much, but they never declined the way oil, gas and coal did. Honestly, I think it’s because the Chinese economy never really shut down completely.”
Cement is unusual compared to other major materials, such as steel, because not only does it require a lot of heat to make, which causes emissions, but the chemical process of making cement itself produces a lot of carbon dioxide, the major human-caused long-term heat-trapping gas.
The recipe for cement requires lots of a key ingredient called clinker, the crumbly binding agent in the entire mixture. Clinker is made when limestone, calcium carbonate, is taken out of the ground and heated to 2700 to 2800 degrees (1480 to 1540 degrees Celsius) to turn it into calcium oxide. But that process strips carbon dioxide out of the limestone and it goes into the air, Andrew said.Rick Bohan, senior vice president for sustainability at the industry group Portland Cement Association, said, “in the U.S., 60% of our CO2 is a chemical fact of life... The reality is concrete is a universal building material. There is no single construction project that doesn’t use some amount of concrete in it.”
Cement, which is the key ingredient in concrete, is in buildings, roads and bridges.
“Each person on the planet is consuming on average more than a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cement per day,” said University of California Earth systems scientist Steve Davis. “Obviously, you’re not going to, you know, Home Depot and buying a sack of cement every day. But on your behalf, the roads and buildings and bridges out there are using more than a kilogram. And that’s kind of mind boggling to me.”
Even though there are greener ways to make cement, cutting its emissions dramatically is so difficult and requires such a massive change in infrastructure and the way of doing business, the International Energy Agency doesn’t envision the cement industry getting to zero carbon emissions by 2050. Instead there will still be emissions from cement, steel and aviation that need to be balanced out with negative emissions elsewhere, said IEA researchers Tiffany Voss and Peter Levi.“These are hard, hard to cut,” Andrew said.
But industry’s Bohan said his group is certain that they can get to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, if it gets help from governments and especially cement users to accept and use green cement properly. One of several ways to make greener cement is to mix in fly ash, which is a waste product from burning coal, in place of some of the clinker and he said there’s more than enough fly ash available even with coal use reductions.
IEA’s Voss said the switch to green cement “is not there yet” because of technology, infrastructure and other concerns. But many in and outside the industry are working on the problem.
China is key because it produced more than half of the world’s cement emissions in 2021, with India a distant second at about 9%, Andrew’s data shows. The United States spewed 2.5% of the emissions from cement, ranking fifth behind Vietnam and Turkey.“China is a huge country and its development ramped up,” Andrew said. “It’s driven everything.”
China is not just making and using more cement, but the carbon intensity has been going up a lot lately, IEA’s Voss said. That’s because earlier in its development, China was using cheaper, weaker low-clinker cement and buildings and bridges were collapsing, so now the Chinese government is mandating stronger cement, Norway’s Andrew said.
That’s a reasonable conservatism that slows efforts at making greener cement, Davis said. People are not eager to try untested cement recipes because “these are the structural materials of our society,” he said.
For example, Portland limestone cement has 10% less emissions but customers are so worried about strength they often say they are only willing to use it if they use 10% more, industry’s Bohan said.
Different cement uses have specific needs, such as strength versus longevity but users often just want the strongest and most durable when they don’t need it and this causes unnecessary emissions, Bohan said.And while people talk about curtailing flying, global aviation emissions are less than half of that coming from concrete, according to Global Carbon Project. There’s “flight shaming” among scientists and activists, but no building shaming, Davis said.Cement as it ages does suck some carbon dioxide out of the air, just like trees do, in small measurable, significant amounts, Jackson said.
“Our primary focus needs to be on fossil fuel use because that’s where most emissions come from,” Stanford’s Jackson said. “I don’t think cement is on most policymakers’ radar.”

650,Climate change a factor in ‘unprecedented’ South Asia floods,"Scientists say climate change is a factor behind the erratic and early rains that triggered unprecedented floods in Bangladesh and northeastern India, killing dozens and making lives miserable for millions of others.
Although the region is no stranger to flooding, it typically takes place later in the year when monsoon rains are well underway.
This year’s torrential rainfall lashed the area as early as March. It may take much longer to determine the extent to which climate change played a role in the floods, but scientists say that it has made the monsoon — a seasonable change in weather usually associated with strong rains — more variable over the past decades. This means that much of the rain expected to fall in a year is arriving in a space of weeks.
The northeastern Indian state of Meghalaya received nearly three times its average June rainfall in just the first three weeks of the month, and neighboring Assam received twice its monthly average in the same period. Several rivers, including one of Asia’s largest, flow downstream from the two states into the Bay of Bengal in low-lying Bangladesh, a densely populated delta nation.With more rainfall predicted over the next five days, Bangladesh’s Flood Forecast and Warning Centre warned Tuesday that water levels would remain dangerously high in the country’s northern regions.The pattern of monsoons, vital for the agrarian economies of India and Bangladesh, has been shifting since the 1950s, with longer dry spells interspersed with heavy rain, said Roxy Matthew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, adding that extreme rainfall events were also projected to increase.
Until now, floods in northeastern Bangladesh were rare while Assam state, famed for its tea cultivation, usually coped with floods later in the year during the usual monsoon season. The sheer volume of early rain this year that lashed the region in just a few weeks makes the current floods an “unprecedented” situation, said Anjal Prakash, a research director at India’s Bharti Institute of Public Policy, who has contributed to a U.N.-sponsored study on global warming.
“This is something that we have never heard of and never seen,” he said.
Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina gave a similarly grim assessment Wednesday.
“We haven’t faced a crisis like this for a long time. Infrastructure must be constructed to cope with such disasters,” she told a news conference in Dhaka. “The water coming from Meghalaya and Assam has affected the Sylhet region” in northeastern Bangladesh, she said, adding that there is no quick respite for the country.
Hasina said that floodwaters would recede soon from the northeast, but they would likely hit the country’s southern region soon on the way to the Bay of Bengal.
“We should prepare to face it,” she said. “We live in a region where flooding happens quite often, which we have to bear in mind. We must prepare for that.”
A total of 42 people have died in Bangladesh since May 17 while Indian authorities reported that flood deaths have risen to 78 in Assam state, with 17 others killed in landslides.
Hundreds of thousands are displaced and millions in the region have been forced to scramble to makeshift evacuation centers.Bangladesh, home to about 160 million, has historically contributed a fraction of the world’s emissions. Meanwhile, a decade-old deal for rich nations, who have contributed more to global emissions, to give $100 billion to poorer nations every year to adapt to climate change and switch to cleaner fuels hasn’t been fulfilled. And the money that is provided is spread too thin.
That means that countries like Bangladesh — whose GDP has risen from $6.2 billion in 1972 to $305 billion in 2019 — have to redirect funds to combat climate change, instead of of spending it on policies aimed at lifting millions from poverty.
“This is a problem which is created by the global industrialized north. And we are paying the price for it because they have ignored their responsibility,” Prakash said.
In the hardest-hit city of Sylhet, shop owner Mohammad Rashiq Ahamed has returned home with his families to see what can be salvaged from floods. Wading through knee-deep water, he said that he was worried about waters rising again. “The weather is changing ... there can be another disaster, at any time.”He is one of about 3.5 million Bangladeshis who face the same predicament each year when rivers flood, according to a 2015 analysis by the World Bank Institute. Bangladesh is considered one of the most vulnerable to climate change and the poor are disproportionately impacted.
Parul Akhter, a poultry farmer, held on to her disabled son to save him from the floodwaters in Sylhet. But she lost her only income — her chickens — and all other belongings.
“The chicken farm was the only way for me to live. I have no other means to earn,” she said.
Mohammad Arfanuzzaman, a climate change expert at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, said that catastrophic floods like the one this year could have wide-ranging impacts, from farmers losing their crops and being trapped in a cycle of debt to children not being able to go to school and at increased risk to disease.
“Poor people are suffering a lot from the ongoing flooding,” he said.","Scientists say climate change is a factor behind the erratic and early rains that triggered unprecedented floods in Bangladesh and northeastern India .Although the region is no stranger to flooding, it typically takes place later in the year when monsoon rains are well underway .This year’s torrential rainfall lashed the area as early as March .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/issues/climate-change-a-factor-in-unprecedented-south-asia-floods-1,Nepal News,issues,6/23/2022 7:42
649,Misogyny: Common foe for Nepal’s working class,"Male dominance continues to enforce harmful stereotypes and create unfavorable environments for women making it difficult for them to excel. Such discrimination leads to women being less and less able to succeed in the labor market.
The Right to Employment Act, 2075 (2018) guarantees the right of every citizen to work and employment irrespective of their identity or sex; however, many women complain that even though they qualify for much higher positions, only men are elected for such positions. However, discrimination in workplace is not a new concern, it has been the same for decades, the only thing that has changed is the ways. Societal expectations and beliefs about women’s leadership abilities is one of the major reason of discrimination in workplace for women in Nepal.
“When I first started working, misogyny was out in the open. It was a known fact but now it is an unconscious trait due to deep rooted Patriarchal values, even though it is not intentional.”, claimed Shanti Shrish, medical advisor to MdM France, an International INGO. She explained that in her 20 years of working career, and after changing half a dozen jobs, she has faced her fair share of discriminations and knows exactly how demotivating it can be.
“Women in positions higher than men are looked down upon and often ignored, since women are not traditionally the one to give orders. However, such prejudices can jeopardize the performance of women,” she further added.

647,How safe are journalists in Nepal?,"Various state and non-state bodies are found to be responsible for creating problems for the press. It can be either to suppress truth or to establish fear of reporting against the concerned bodies. Nepal is one of the few countries in the world to proclaim ‘total freedom of the press’ in the preamble to its Constitution which is expressed in several fundamental rights, including freedom of opinion and expression along with public access to information and privacy.
“There have been threats to journalists for decades and in the last year alone 82 incidents of attacks on journalists have been reported”, said Bipul Pokharel, Chairperson of Federation of Nepali Journalists during the South Asian consultation on the UN Plan of action on the safety of journalists organized by UNESCO. He further added, “ Journalists are now facing digital harassment more often with the increase in social media usage. There have also been various professional and physical harassment recorded against journalists.”
Sangita Khadka, Chairperson of the Minimum Wage Fixation Committee said, “ The biggest problem for journalists is economic threat”. Journalists are rarely paid in accordance with this salary table. As a result, the profession is financially unrewarding, straining journalists’ independence and their respect for ethics. Many feel demotivated and also become economically unstable to continue this profession.
On the other hand, protection mechanisms for journalists do exist, upheld notably by Press Council Nepal and the National Human Rights Commission but they are quite incapable of offering urgent solutions for reporters in danger. Also many actions have been taken to economically strengthen journalists by both profit and nonprofit organizations.

""I love the Queen's new hairstyle!!!"" one fan commented, while another added, ""The Queen looks wonderful! Her new summer hairdo looks perfect.""
In the revised edition of her book, ""The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser, and the Wardrobe,"" Angela Kelly, a personal assistant to Her Majesty, discusses assuming the extra function of hairdresser during the pandemic.
""From March 2020 onwards I washed The Queen's hair every week, set and styled it, and even trimmed it when needed. My team named it Kelly's Salon,"" she wrote.
""During the first two weeks, I was shaking. I had only done her hair once or twice before while on board the Royal Yacht Britannia. The Queen was so kind as she advised me on the very specific way to put the rollers in.""
""As I grew in confidence I'm sure The Queen thought I was a professional and started shouting at me, 'Don't do that, do it this way. That's right, you've got it, don't change it,'"" she continued. ""I was thinking, goodness me, I need a gin and tonic. So while The Queen was under the dryer I said to her, 'I'm off for a stiff drink because this is so stressful, getting it just right for you.'""
The longtime royal aide also divulged she would use ""a whole can of hairspray to make sure it lasted the week.""","Queen Elizabeth II is beginning her 71st year as monarch in a new style .Following her Platinum Jubilee celebrations earlier this month, the monarch seems to have changed up her look .The 96-year-old monarch's silver strands appear notably shorter at the sides and back .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/entertainment-and-lifestyle/queen-elizabeth-gets-new-haircut-after-platinum-jubilee,Nepal News,entertainment-and-lifestyle,6/25/2022 17:59
626,Indian cricket fraternity celebrates anniversary of 1983 World Cup triumph,"As India celebrates the 39th anniversary of its World Cup victory, legendary cricketers like Virender Sehwag and VVS Laxman took to their social media accounts to thank the 1983 World Cup legends for inspiring many to represent the country someday.
Today, India is celebrating the completion of the 39 years of the maiden World Cup victory under the leadership of legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev.
Former Indian opener Virender Sehwag in a tweet said, ""Date mein kya rakha hai? Well, 25th June, is date mein shuruaat rakhi hai. It is a day on which India began it's journey-in 1932 playing it's first ever Test & 51 years later on 25th June 1983, Kapil Paaji & his boys winning the World Cup,which was a beginning for many cricketers.""
""Today in 1983 was when every Indian got the feeling that dreams can be brought to reality! A moment that will make us proud always! I, like many others was inspired by this win and started dreaming of representing the country someday,"" wrote Former India batter and current National Cricket Academy (NCA) chief VVS Laxman in a tweet.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India also remembered the historical day and tweeted, ""A historic day & a landmark moment for Indian cricket as #TeamIndia, led by @therealkapildev, clinched the World Cup title.""
While International Cricket Council (ICC) said, ""India win their maiden World Cup On this day in 1983, Kapil Dev's team stunned the world by beating the mighty West Indies to lift the @CricketWorldCup.""
Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah took to his Twitter and wrote, ""#Onthisday in 1983, #TeamIndia won its first ever World Cup by defeating the defending champions West Indies & lifted the. The dedication and fight back spirit of the team led by @therealkapildev made it one of the most important days in India's cricketing history.""
In 1983, the World Cup final was played between India and West Indies and the latter won the toss and opted to bowl first.
The Kapil Dev-led side managed to score just 183 runs as Andy Roberts took three wickets while Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding, and Larry Gomes picked up two wickets each. Defending 183, India did a good job of keeping a check on the Windies run flow, reducing the side to 57/3.
Soon after, the team from the Caribbean was reduced to 76/6 and India was the favourites from there on to win the title. Mohinder Amarnath took the final wicket of Michael Holding to give India their first-ever World Cup title win. In the finals, West Indies was bowled out for 140, and as a result, India won the match by 43 runs.
Kapil Dev lifting the trophy at the balcony of Lord's Cricket Ground still remains an image to savour for all the Indian fans.
In the finals, Mohinder Amarnath was chosen as the Man of the Match as he scored 26 runs with the bat and also picked up three wickets with the ball.
India has been a regular participant in the World Cup from its beginning to the latest edition. The first edition was held in 1975 and from there on, it has taken place a span of every four years.
West Indies won the first two World Cup titles (1975, 1979) and was the runner-up in 1983. India has won the title two times, in 1983 and in 2011.
MS Dhoni captained the 2011 team to win their second title after 28 years. Australia has won the tournament five times (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015).","India are celebrating the 39th anniversary of their maiden World Cup victory .Virender Sehwag and VVS Laxman took to their social media accounts to thank the 1983 World Cup legends .In 1983, the World Cup final was played between India and West Indies .The Kapil Dev-led side managed to score just 183 runs as Andy Roberts too .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/sports/indian-cricket-fraternity-celebrates-anniversary-of-1983-world-cup-triumph,Nepal News,sports,6/25/2022 18:04
625,Plant-based substitutes provide lesser protein in comparison to chicken,"According to a recent study, the human body receives less amount of protein from plant-based substitutes as compared to chicken.
The study was published in the journal, 'Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry'. Osvaldo Campanella, Da Chen and colleagues wanted to go a step further and see if human cells can absorb similar amounts of peptides from a model meat alternative as they can from a piece of chicken.
The researchers have created a model meat alternative made of soy and wheat gluten with the extrusion process. When cut open, the material had long fibrous pieces inside, just like chicken. Cooked pieces of the substitute and chicken meat were then ground up and broken down with an enzyme that humans use to digest food.
In vitro tests showed that meat-substitute peptides were less water-soluble than those from chicken, and they also were not absorbed as well by human cells. With this new understanding, the researchers say the next step is to identify other ingredients that could help boost the peptide uptake of plant-based meat substitutes. ",In vitro tests showed that meat-substitute peptides were less water-soluble than those from chicken .Researchers say the next step is to identify other ingredients that could help boost the peptide uptake of plant-based meat substitutes .,https://www.nepalnews.com/s/health/plant-based-substitutes-provide-lesser-protein-in-comparison-to-chicken,Nepal News,health,6/25/2022 18:09
624,Imran Khan challenges National Accountability Bureau ordinance in court," Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday approached the country's top court to challenge the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government's recent amendments to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Ordinance, contending that they will ""virtually eliminate any white-collar crime committed by a public office holder"".
The Amendment was criticised by Imran and his party.
""They should be put in jail for their shamelessness. Nobody can pass such laws shamelessly -- as this government did,"" he said, Geo News had reported.
Imran Khan had explained how the leaders of the two big political parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) would be ""saved"" after the changes. He said the government amended section 14 of the law, which now states that a person will only be held accountable for the ""money left in the fake accounts (when a person is arrested)"".
""If I am a public office holder earning an income of Rs 50, then I will have to explain why I have assets worth Rs 100 and where did I get the extra Rs 50 from. But now, they have reversed the role and the NAB will have to explain how did a public office holder get extra assets,"" he said.
Khan said after the NAB law amendments, the watchdog will have to prove whether a person accumulated wealth illicitly -- as the government has shifted the burden from the person to the watchdog, reported Geo News.
The second change, Khan said was made to the assets beyond means -- section 9 -- of the NAB law, which will provide relief to ""major government leaders"".
The PTI chairman had said under the current tax laws, a person has to provide the trail of his money as the onus lies on them, not the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
The bill, along with the one on election reforms, was passed by the National Assembly and Senate last month. After its approval from both houses, the president's assent was required for it to become law, Dawn newspaper reported. ","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday approached the country's top court to challenge the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government's recent amendments to the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance, contending that they will ""virtually eliminate any white-collar crime committed by a public office holder""Khan had explained how the leaders of the two big political parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), would be ""saved"" after the changes .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/global/imran-khan-challenges-national-accountability-bureau-ordinance-in-court,Nepal News,global,6/25/2022 19:18

617,Government slashes Rs 20 per litre in petrol and Rs 29 in diesel,"The government has decided to slash the price of petroleum products.
A cabinet meeting on Saturday decided to reduce Rs 20 per litre in petrol and Rs 29 in diesel, shared Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Dilendra Prasad Badu at a press conference.
According to him, with the new decision coming into effect, a litre of petrol will cost RS 179 and diesel Rs 163. The new price decision will come into effect from Saturday midnight.
""This is the decision of today's meeting of the Council of Ministers. The decision was taken acting on the recommendations"", Minister Badu noted.
The excessive hike in the petro product price hit hard the people's life, he said, adding the decision was taken to slash the price so as to give respite to the commoners.
The price was slashed with an intention to render relief to the people even by reducing tax that has been imposed on petro products. ""The new measure will moderately render relief to the people. However, this is not a permanent solution"",
Market monitoring to be made effective
The government has decided to make market monitoring effective so as to control price and avoid shortage of daily consumptive goods.
Minister Badu expressed his confidence that price control would be tightened through effective market monitoring in coordination with federal, provincial and local governments.
The Minister urged the business community to reduce the price of all consumptive goods in the market to cooperate government in its bid to render relief to the people.
Those found increasing market price in the consumptive goods illegally would be booked, he said, calling for support from the media and consumers to that end.
In view of people marred by increasing price of petroleum products fuelled by price hike in the international market, the government has decided to decrease their price in Nepal to some extent in a bid to give some respite to people, said minister Badu.
This followed the direction by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to readjust price of petroleum products to give a relief to people, he added.
To that end, a meeting of top leaders of ruling coalition held on Saturday under the leadership of PM Deuba took the decision. The meeting was attended by secretary of the respective ministries and high ranking officials of the Nepal Oil Corporation, a monopoly government-owned enterprise that imports, stores and distributes petroleum products.
To decrease consumption of petroleum products and LP gas, the government would encourage use of electric cooktops and electric vehicles, said minister Badu in the meantime.
Provisions related to encouraging the use of electric appliances and vehicles in the budget will be implemented acting on recommendation by a high level taskforce formed under the leadership of National Planning Commission Vice-chair. Government offices will use electric vehicles while fuel-run old and heavy vehicles will be converted into electric ones.
To reduce supply of petroleum products, steps would be taken through advices of experts and learning from practices in other countries, said the minister, adding NOC would be made robust and effective acting on advices from the taskforce.","With the new decision coming into effect, a litre of petrol will cost RS 179 and diesel Rs 163 .Price was slashed with an intention to render relief to the people even by reducing tax that has been imposed on petro products .Government has decided to make market monitoring effective so as to control price and avoid shortage of daily consumptive goods .",https://www.nepalnews.com/s/nation/government-slashes-rs-20-per-litre-in-petrol-and-rs-29-in-diesel,Nepal News,nation,6/25/2022 16:38
616,Crisis brewing in Unified Socialist as 10 of its lawmakers up the ante,"A crisis is brewing in the CPN (Unified Socialist).Four of its ministers in the Sher Bahadur Deuba Cabinet, who have defied the party decision to recall them, on Friday got the backing of six lawmakers in piling pressure on the leadership, particularly party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal.The 10 lawmakers submitted a memorandum demanding a Parliamentary Party meeting at the earliest. They have also expressed their displeasure at the party Standing Committee’s decision earlier this month to recall the four ministers.The party on June 5 decided to recall Birodh Khatiwada, Ram Kumari Jhakri, Prem Ale and Krishna Kumar Shrestha and send a new set of leaders—Jeevan Ram Shrestha, Metmani Chaudhary, Sher Bahadur Kunwar, promote state minister Bhawani Khapung as full minister for health and population, and Hira Chandra KC as minister of state for health.“We have registered a memorandum at the party headquarters to discuss the party’s decision to recall the ministers,” Health Minister Birodh Khatiwada told the Post.Along with Khatiwada, Urban Development Minister Ram Kumari Jhakri, Labour Minister Krishna Kumar Shrestha and Tourism Minister Prem Ale as well as lawmakers Krishnalal Maharjan, Nirudevi Jairu, Dhan Bahadur Budha, Pushpa Kumari Karna Kayastha, Bina Devi Budhathoki and Gopal Bahadur Bam have signed the memorandum. Submitting the letter to party chair Nepal, the lawmakers said that the decision to change ministers at a time when the discussions on the budget were ongoing was uncalled for. Demanding a meeting of the Parliamentary Party, the lawmakers have also put forth some conditions for changing the ministers, including adherence to the principle of inclusivity. Born in August last year, the Unified Socialist has 24 lawmakers in the House. With 10 lawmakers, or 40 percent, defying the party diktat, Madhav Nepal is clearly under pressure and must be experiencing déjà vu.It was under the leadership of Nepal, some had launched a campaign against CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. They also had defied party orders. However, 10 of key leaders including Ghanashyam Bhusal, Bhim Rawal and Yogesh Bhattarai fighting Oli decided to remain in the UML, and others sided with Nepal to form the Unified Socialist. While Jhakri firmly stood by Nepal, Ale and Shrestha played an instrumental role in helping him constitute the party.Insiders say Nepal is on the backfoot. Despite the Standing Committee taking the decision, he cannot force Jhakri, Ale and Shrestha to comply with it. Any pressure, he fears, could prompt them to quit the party, leaving him marooned. In the worst case scenario, he could even see an end to his political career. Otherwise, also, his nine-month-old party will be in disarray if the 10 lawmakers decide to quit.Meanwhile, Jhala Nath Khanal, a senior leader of the party, too has been saying that it’s up to the leadership [Nepal] to implement the decision taken by the party. Khanal and Nepal too appear to have drifted apart lately, with the former making a strong push for a “left alliance” on which the latter is not very keen.“As the party’s Central Committee meeting is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, it will come up with a concrete decision regarding the ongoing mess of change in ministers,” Khanal told the Post. “I don’t think there will be any problem within the party and the party will remain intact.”The party has called its Central Committee meeting for Saturday and Sunday, and Central Council meeting for Monday and Tuesday in which 1,700 representatives will participate. At Friday’s politburo meeting, Nepal told leaders that the activities of the ministers would be an issue of discipline violation and that the party’s decision will be implemented soon. Nepal, according to politburo members, told the ministers that they would get a chance to become ministers after the polls and therefore they need not worry much. Many leaders speaking on Friday criticised the ministers saying their activities violated party discipline.However, the issue of the ministers’ eight-point memorandum was not on the agenda for the discussion and during the meeting, 40 politburo members aired their views on the organisational report presented by the party chairman.On Friday, Nepal also blamed CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal for blocking the oath of new ministers recommended by the CPN (Unified Socialist). “Dahal is also responsible for the delay in implementing our decision because he fears a reshuffle in the Cabinet will create pressure on his party,” politburo member Metmani Chaudhary quoted Nepal as saying at Friday’s politburo meeting. “At first, reshuffle was delayed due to the budget and now due to the possible problem in the coalition.”Gangalal Tuladhar, deputy general secretary of the party, said although the party leaders have been blaming leaders of the coalition partner parties and the prime minister for delaying the implementation of the party’s decision, if the letter floated in the media is the one handed over to the party chair, it is clear that it’s our own ministers who are piling pressure on the leadership. He said the leaders did not blame the ministers but pointed fingers at the prime minister for delaying the implementation of the party's decisions.“But today’s activities have proved that the ministers were creating pressure on the prime minister and Maoist Centre chair Dahal, and now they are trying to keep the party under pressure,” he said.“This is unfortunate,” Tuladhar told the Post.  ","The party on June 5 decided to recall Birodh Khatiwada, Ram Kumari Jhakri, Prem Ale and Krishna Kumar Shrestha .The lawmakers have also put forth some conditions for changing the ministers, including adherence to the principle of inclusivity .",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/06/25/crisis-brewing-in-unified-socialist-as-10-of-its-lawmakers-up-the-ante,Kathmandu Post,Politics ,6/25/2022 6:59
615,House committee orders fuel tax cut as Nepalis struggle with rising prices,"Nepalis are being hit by runaway inflation after having endured years of slow growth caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.With food and fuel prices through the roof, the Nepali economy could encounter another setback, and poverty can be expected to rise, economists say. In a move that has raised hope among the people of seeing some respite, the Industry, Commerce, Labour and Consumer Welfare Protection Committee of Parliament on Friday directed the government to slash the taxes on petroleum products by half.But experts say it's easier said than done. Taxes on fuel imports are among the government's most important revenue sources, and it is reluctant to forego the bonanza created by rising oil prices.In the first 11 months of the fiscal year ended mid-June, Nepal's fuel import bill almost doubled from the previous year. Imports were valued at Rs340 billion, compared to Rs191.18 billion in the same period last year.The government earned Rs118.82 billion in various taxes levied on the fuel imports. The high taxes have drawn much criticism against the government.Sushil Bhattarai, deputy managing director of the state-owned Nepal Oil Corporation, said they had discussed the issue with the House committee. “But slashing taxes is in the hands of the Finance Ministry.” On June 19, the Nepal Oil Corporation increased the prices of petrol by a steep Rs21 per litre, and diesel and kerosene by Rs27 per litre, the highest increment ever made by the oil monopoly.Following the price hikes, petrol costs Rs199 per litre, diesel Rs192 per litre and kerosene Rs192 per litre.The oil monopoly also jacked up the price of aviation fuel sold to domestic airlines by Rs19 per litre to Rs185 per litre. International airlines have to shell out $1,645 per kilolitre, up $100 per kilolitre.According to the Nepal Oil Corporation, the government collects Rs65.61 in taxes on every litre of petrol sold at Rs199. It collects Rs49.53 on every litre of diesel sold which now costs Rs192 per litre. The Finance Ministry said it was not aware of the parliamentary committee's orders.“We have not received any official communication from the House committee. Once we receive the letter, we may move ahead to cut taxes,” said Dhundi Prasad Niraula, spokesperson for the Finance Ministry. “But before implementing the committee's instructions, we need to analyse the matter properly,” Niraula said.  Source: Nepal Oil CorporationThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has pushed up inflation, and most countries have been experiencing rising prices since last year. Fuel, as measured by world oil prices, and international food prices rose throughout 2021 and the trend continued in 2022.Many countries are making various efforts to rein in inflation.On May 21, India’s federal government decided to cut the excise duty on petrol and diesel in an attempt to control high levels of inflation.In Spain, where inflation hit a decades-high 8.7 percent in May, the government decided to cut the electricity tax by half to ease the inflation pain. On June 22, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a VAT reduction from 10 percent to 5 percent.European countries are cutting their already reduced VAT rates on domestic energy, petrol and foods.United States President Joe Biden is considering a gas tax holiday to provide relief to the American people, many of whom are having a hard time because of rising gas prices.In Nepal, transport fares went up immediately after the Nepal Oil Corporation raised fuel prices.The Department of Transport Management allowed transport entrepreneurs to hike fares by 5.30 percent. For cargo carriers plying Tarai and hill routes, the fares have been hiked by 7.7 percent and 6.94 percent, respectively.On June 20, the Airlines Operators Association of Nepal increased the fuel surcharge added to airfares by Rs170 to Rs840, depending on the distance.“Rising inflation could impact economic growth as investors tend not to invest and consumers tend to cut their expenses and eat less, thus reducing the flow of money in the market,” economist Govinda Nepal told the Post in a recent interview.Economist Jagadish Chandra Pokharel said that the parliamentary committee order to cut taxes can be a relief to the people.“A tax cut for a short duration is the best way to rein in runaway inflation. But Nepal also needs to think of an alternative to fossil fuels,” Pokharel said.According to the World Bank, especially concerning are negative impacts on the poorest and most vulnerable households in urban areas, which spend a large proportion of their total income on food and other basic commodities.They are suffering the harshest effects of rising prices. To cushion the impacts of inflation on the poor, governments should ramp up support through well targeted social protection programmes, the World Bank said.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the year-on-year consumer price inflation jumped to a staggering 7.87 percent in May, hitting a 69-month high. It was 3.65 percent in May last year.  ","The Industry, Commerce, Labour and Consumer Welfare Protection Committee of Parliament has directed the government to slash the taxes on petroleum products by half .But experts say it's easier said than done .In the first 11 months of the fiscal year ended mid-June, Nepal's fuel import bill almost doubled from the previous year .",https://kathmandupost.com/money/2022/06/25/house-committee-orders-fuel-tax-cut-as-nepalis-struggle-with-rising-prices,Kathmandu Post,Money ,6/25/2022 10:07
614,Kantipur-HISSAN Education fair kicks off,"The seventh edition of Kantipur-Higher Institutions and Secondary Schools’ Association Nepal (HISSAN) Education Fair kicked off at Bhrikutimandap Exhibition Hall, in Kathmandu, on Friday.The four-day fair was inaugurated by Minister of State Umesh Shrestha. The fair is organised targeting students who are awaiting results of grades 10 and 12 and provides information on colleges and courses they can opt for. Speaking at the inauguration, Shrestha stressed how Nepal has the potential to become a hub for higher studies and requested investors to put their money in education and become more service-oriented. A large number of students leaving the country to pursue higher studies is concerning, says Shrestha. “New universities should be set up with the vision to provide the best possible education in the country itself. These education centres need not be Kathmandu-centric and should branch out to other equally deserving cities to make world-class education available in Nepal,” said Shrestha. He further stressed the need for setting up vocational training centres so that the students can have the opportunity to receive skill-based education for immediate job prospects in the market. According to the Education Under-Secretary of No Objection Certificate (NOC), Hari Prasad Niraula, 102,873 individuals received NOC in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year ended mid-June for different countries. “If we could make a conducive environment here for students to receive better education, it will save a lot of effort and money for students,” said Shrestha, who is also a former president of HISSAN. The first edition of the education fair was held six years ago and had been on hold since 2019 due to the global pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. “We are happy that after a gap of two years, we are able to give continuity to this annual fair,” said Mahesh Swar, assistant general manager of the Kantipur Media Group. “Our children are migrating for higher education in larger numbers than ever before. So the motive of this fair is to let them choose the best colleges within the country so that they can receive quality education in Nepal itself,” he said. HISSAN President Ramesh Kumar Silwal said such events are important for students and parents who do not know their future course of action in terms of education. Seventy-five educational institutions affiliated with various universities including Tribhuvan University, Pokhara University, Purbanchal University, Mid-West University, and the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) are participating in the annual fair this year. The organisers estimate around 200,000 people including students, parents and stakeholders will visit the fair.Meanwhile, Mahashram Sharma, chairman of the National Examination Board, says it is important to dwell on the crux of the student migration issue. “We must ask ourselves as to why more and more students are leaving the country for higher education. We must start thinking where we have lagged in terms of providing good education to our children,” he said. He also stressed the importance of implementing a public-private partnership modality in the education sector and making the education system inclusive for students from remote areas of the country like Humla, Jumla, and the Terai region.“We can’t give better education to students without qualified teachers so we must train our teachers. The examination board is working towards providing training to teachers in particular areas of teaching,” said Sharma. The title sponsor of the event is ‘My Second Teacher,’ an online education platform which provides digital learning experience. The main sponsor is the Golden Gate International College.The fair starts from 10am to 5pm for the next four days. Entry is free for all.  ","The fair is organised targeting students who are awaiting results of grades 10 and 12 .Minister of State Umesh Shrestha stressed how Nepal has the potential to become a hub for higher studies .A large number of students leaving the country to pursue higher studies is concerning, says Shrestha .",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/25/kantipur-hissan-education-fair-kicks-off,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/25/2022 8:21
613,Nepal bow out after rain washes out semi-final match,"Nepal national women’s cricket team could not qualify for the ACC Women’s Twenty20 Asia Cup 2022 after their semi-final match against the United Arab Emirates was called off due to rain on Friday.The no result means the UAE qualified for the October finals in Bangladesh after progressing into the final of the ACC Women’s Twenty20 Championship as Group ‘A’ winners due to the absence of a reserve day.The final match is scheduled for Saturday.Only the two teams making it to the Championship final would book their tickets to the Asia Cup.The UAE will now face Malaysia in the final in Kuala Lumpur after Winifred Duraisingam’s side defeated Hong Kong women by 12 runs in a rain-reduced second semi-final.Fresh from demolishing Qatar by 153 runs in their last group match on Wednesday, an unbeaten UAE arrived at the Kinrara Academy Oval as favourites to advance into the final.But Nepali pace bowler Asmina Karmacharya crippled the UAE batting line up with 5-10 after sending them to bat first as Chaya Mughal’s team were skittled for just 81 in 19.5 overs.Medium pacer Indu Barma returned the match figures of 3-16. Sita Rana Magar also pocketed two wickets.Karmacharya removed opener Theertha Satish for 5 runs in the first delivery of the fourth over before taking the prized scalp of UAE’s star batter Esha Oza—who hit the tournament’s first century in her 67-ball 115 against Qatar on Wednesday—for just 15 to reduce the UAE at 24-2 in the sixth over.The casualties of the openers started a collapse as the UAE lost wickets at regular intervals.After Rana Magar trapped Kavisha Egodage (3) lbw in the next over, Khushi Sharma (12) and skipper Mughal (14) tried to steady the innings putting on 20 runs but the UAE found themselves in the hot water after Barma broke the momentum having had both caught.Samaira Dharnidharka, trapped leg before by Barma, and Priyanjali Jain, caught behind off Rana Magar, then departed cheaply for 7 and 4 runs respectively.Vaishnave Mahesh top scored for the UAE with 16 facing 11 deliveries but she too fell flat against lethal Karmacharya in the 19.2 overs. The pacer then removed Indhuja Nandakumar and Sita Gokhhale (both for nought) giving Nepal a renewed hope of reaching the final.The 82-run target would not have been a challenging total for Rubina Chhetry’s team.But persistent rain played spoilsport and washed out the second innings without a single ball being bowled, shutting the door to Nepal’s dreams of qualifying for the Asia finals for a third time despite an exceptional performance.Karmacharya took the tournament highest eight wickets. Rana Magar and Sangita Rai have seven wickets each to their name. The second semi-final was also hit by rain and was reduced to 11-over-a-side.Sent to bat first after losing the toss, opener and skipper Duraisingam scored 26 and Mas Elysa hit an unbeaten 33 to steer the hosts to 86-4.In reply, Sasha Azmi took 2-16 and Nik Nur Atiela pocketed 2-9 to turn the tables on Malaysia’s side as they restricted the Group ‘B’ winners to 74-8 to set up the UAE final.The UAE and Malaysia will join India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand in the Asia Cup.

609,Monsoon means disaster in Madhes Province,"Every year during the monsoon, floods and inundations wreak havoc in Madhesh Province which comprises eight Tarai districts. Thousands of people face displacement, loss of lives and property due to the lack of preparedness by the authorities to control such water-induced disasters.In Saptari, a Musahar settlement in Hanumannagar Kankalini Municipality-4 is at high risk of floods as the Mahuli stream has started eroding the embankment. The 10 impoverished Dalit families of the settlement, who are living on encroached land, are living in fear of displacement as the government authorities and people’s representatives have not taken any initiatives to protect the settlement from the floods.“The settlement is being eroded by the Mahuli stream in the west and a small water outlet from the east. One house was swept away recently while others are at high risk. We are encircled by floods but nobody is concerned about our plight,” said Manju Devi Sada, a resident of the Musahar settlement.On Monday night, the area received heavy rainfall and the water level in the Mahuli stream increased, trapping the villagers inside the settlement. “The erosion is increasing day by day. The settlement will turn into a sandy bank within a few days if the stream and rivulet are not controlled immediately. We have nowhere to go if the floods displace us,” said Manju Devi. She urged the concerned authorities and the local unit to protect their settlement from flooding and erosion.According to Mauli Mandal, the ward chairman of Hanumannagar Kankalini-4, the flood waters flowing from the northern side last year eroded the area near the Musahar settlement and emptied into the Mahuli stream. He admitted that the settlement is at high risk of floods this year too.“The flood already swept away a house while others are at risk. Efforts are underway to control the floods and protect the settlement by installing hume pipes,” said Birendra Majhi, the mayor of Hanumannagar Kankalini. In mid-July last year, Chandiya village in Rajdevi Municipality-3 of Rautahat was inundated following continuous rainfall. Every single house in the village was submerged. The villagers left their houses and ran. Some people were injured when their houses collapsed.Jayram Shah recalls his house collapsing while his whole family was inside. “We nearly died. All of us suffered injuries,” said Shah. Every monsoon, Chandiya residents struggle to keep afloat and save themselves and their properties from floods in the Bagmati River. The floodwaters from the river enter the village every year resulting in floods and inundation. “Nobody can understand our situation except us. We suffer every year. The government does nothing to address our problem,” said Shah.There are about 200 households in Chandiya village and all of them have been displaced by monsoon disasters. A 44 km-long dam has been constructed with the help of the Government of India to prevent loss of property due to floods in the Bagmati River. All the displaced folks from Chandiya have to take shelter in the dam area every year. The villages bordering Chandiya, including the district headquarters Gaur, are living the same fate. The floodwaters from the Lalbakaiya and Bagmati rivers inundate the settlement during the monsoon and inundate 80 percent of the land every year. Three days ago, the district administration instructed the local units in the district to start preparing for water-induced disasters this monsoon. “We spend our days and nights worrying about how to save our lives and the lives of our family during the rainy season. We have been suffering for the past 29 years and it seems like the government does not want to listen to us,” said Pramod Das of Durga Bhagwati Rural Municipality-5.There are about 300 houses built in and around the dam area in the Bagmati River and all of them are at high risk of being submerged this rainy season. According to Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Shahi, the main problem of Rautahat has always been floods and inundation. The office has instructed all its local units to be prepared for water-induced disasters. According to the data of the District Police Office in Rautahat, 90 people have been killed in floods and inundation in different parts of the district in the last three years. Six people, including two women, have gone missing, about 70,000 households have been affected, 20,000 families displaced and over 400 cattle killed in the floods.  ","Every year during the monsoon, floods and inundations wreak havoc in Madhesh Province which comprises eight Tarai districts .Thousands of people face displacement, loss of lives and property due to the lack of preparedness to control such water-induced disasters .In Saptari, a Musahar settlement in Hanumannagar Kankalini Municipality-4 is at high risk of floods as the Mahuli stream has started eroding the embankment .",https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-2/2022/06/25/monsoon-means-disaster-in-madhes-province,Kathmandu Post,Madhesh Province ,6/25/2022 12:32
608,Lalitpur launches animal ambulance service,"The Lalitpur Metropolitan City has launched an animal veterinary ambulance service with the aim to provide immediate medical attention to street dogs and stray animals in the City. Lalitpur Mayor Chiri Babu Maharjan on Wednesday handed over the ambulance to Sneha’s care, a non-profit organisation that has been working for the welfare of street dogs and stray animals since 2014, for operation. “We are concerned about the increasing number of stray dogs and animals abandoned on the road. We want to solve this problem,” said Maharjan, who is serving as the City’s mayor for the second time after winning the local polls held on May 13.  Underscoring the City’s efforts to make Lalitpur an inclusive city, Maharjan also spoke about the disabled-friendly cab service in the City started in 2020 along with free vehicle service for elderly people to reach their respective ward offices. “The City has been providing free transport service to the disabled and the elderly. Now we have decided to focus on the welfare of the street animals,” said Maharjan, speaking at the inauguration of the veterinary ambulance on Wednesday. “There are many stray dogs and animals on the streets in need of care. Some are in need of medical treatment while others need to be rescued and rehabilitated.” Stray animals are a common sight on almost every street in Kathmandu Valley. According to Sneha’s Care, more than 10,000 street animals die every year in Nepal from illnesses, diseases and accidents. The metropolis’ latest move to help animal rescue and rehabilitation has been applauded by veterinary doctors, animal rights activists and urban planners. Sital Kaji Shrestha, president of the Nepal Veterinary Association, praised the City’s initiative. “Although the Central Veterinary Laboratory has its veterinary ambulance, it has never been used to rescue street animals,” said Shrestha. “The City’s partnership with Sneha’s Care is a commendable step. This model should be adopted by other local units as well.” Shrestha questions the effectiveness of the work of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Department which he says has so far been indifferent to the plight of stray animals and has no data on urban stray animals and community animals. However, it is not only the ministry that has not kept any record of the number of strays and community animals. None of the local authorities in Kathmandu has the exact data. If a decade-old data is to go by, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has over 26,000 stray dogs. Lalitpur Metropolitan City estimates the number of community and stray dogs in the City to be 10,000. “Latitpur’s mayor is a dog lover. During the pandemic he had coordinated with us to feed the hungry stray dogs in the City,” said Sneha Shrestha, animal rights activist and founder of Sneha’s Care. Sneha’s Care has so far rescued 170 street dogs and sheltered them at Bhainsepati, Lalitpur, according to Sneha’s Care. “Of the total canines rescued, 18 were hit by vehicles and are paralysed dogs. Besides dogs we also have 19 calves that were abandoned on the streets,” she said. The new vet ambulance will provide major assistance in their rescue efforts, says the non-profit group which plans to make optimum use of the ambulance to reach out to street dogs and stray animals in need across the Valley. “We had an old rescue vehicle that needed repair every time, but now the City has trusted us and handed us an ambulance. This will help us a lot,” she said. The veterinary ambulance is equipped to rescue cows and dogs at the same time as it has two different sections to hold the animals. According to the organisation, the new veterinary ambulance will also be used to carry out anti-rabies vaccination and sterilisation drives. “We get over 50 calls from across the Valley for help on a daily basis,” she said. “I also request other local bodies to make plans to rescue and rehabilitate stray animals so that they can be free from a life of pain and torture.” According to Mayor Maharjan, the City has allocated Rs 3,000,000 for the veterinary ambulance, which can accommodate up to 20 dogs at a time.  ","Lalitpur Mayor Chiri Babu Maharjan handed over the ambulance to Sneha’s care .Non-profit organisation has been working for the welfare of street dogs and stray animals since 2014 .More than 10,000 street animals die every year in Nepal from illnesses, diseases and accidents .",https://kathmandupost.com/lalitpur/2022/06/25/lalitpur-launches-animal-ambulance-service,Kathmandu Post,Lalitpur ,6/25/2022 9:54
607,The perils of communal strife and abusive marriage,"K R Meera’s 'Qabar', translated from Malayalam by Nisha Susan, is a personal revelation of a woman fighting against patriarchal forces and a political commentary. The novella also has elements of feminism, and interestingly, the feminist aspect focuses on finding love, rejecting the misconception that feminism is anti-love or anti-men. It is hard to fit this novella into one category or genre as it tackles personal, emotional, and political dilemmas of post-independence India. The magic realism, occult, myths, and the quest for love and justice in a country becoming highly communal with each passing day are meticulously interwoven. The mockery of justice at different levels makes it a sensitive work.The novel is terrific and terrifying at the same time. The young protagonist, Bhavana Sachidanandan, is a district judge and a single mother. She is ambitious and independent, but that doesn’t make her a happy woman. She leaves an abusive marriage, longs for love and intimacy, and doesn’t shy away from it when an opportunity finally comes to her. This way, the narrative breaks away from the regular narrative around women, depicting women only needing financial independence to be happy and not needing love and companionship. While financial freedom empowers women, it doesn’t make them unfit for receiving or longing for love. At the same time, abusive marriages must not be normalised and abusive partners must be held accountable for their behaviour.The choice is not easy, but Bhavana is portrayed as an ambitious woman reiterating the stereotype that ambitious women are not fit to have a happy family or become good mothers. Despite all the advancements elsewhere, the tedious rhetoric of the inability of ambitious women to have a happy family is still widely accepted. Bhavana’s quest for love and respect leads her to divorce and her career as a district judge. The personal becomes political, and the political becomes personal. Kaakkasseri Khayaluddin Thangal is a mythical figure of an ordinary Muslim man hoping for justice in a communally charged country. As represented by Bhavana’s hallucinations of snakes, the drops of poison represent the political venom that is hellbent on destroying peace and diversity in the country. Thangal is a paradoxical character, for he is both a magician and an ordinary man with his traumas of social ostracisation and violence. The surreal romance between him and Bhavana challenges the communal propaganda propagated in the name of saving the nation.Personally, the novel’s most compelling character is Bhavana’s mother, who not only embraces feminism but lives by it. Like in most arranged marriages, she remains lonely in her life and feels affection for a street dog who greets her every day. When her husband refuses to allow her to bring home the street dog, she leaves the house where she doesn’t even have the right to bring a dog. Here lies her staunch resistance against patriarchy and lovelessness that seeps through the lives of most married women. She also resists blind belief in everything, including traditions. In one instance, she tells her daughter about the lies people tell in the name of legends, “This is what happens when you have too much pride in your traditions. You can’t talk about everything openly. Then you end up manufacturing a new legend.”Bhavana’s mother is an avid reader, and she taunts her daughter for not being able to find time to read now that she has a prestigious job. It is remarkable how reading is a rarity among women since it is hardly encouraged in most households. Having experienced this personally, many people still perceive reading as a waste of time unless it brings monetary benefits or when household chores remain unaffected.The backdrop of Ayodhya and the foundation of a temple symbolise communal propaganda and violence used to divide people and create hostility for political reasons. If only India realised that communal conflict was the tactic used by the British to control the colonised people and their resources, then probably most ordinary people would not fall for this propaganda. The deft representation of a nation’s failure to rise above divisive politics is coupled with a woman’s quest for love and a relationship where she is loved, respected, and validated. It doesn’t make sense that love is optional while the institution of marriage is revered even if the couple is not happy. Big questions about loveless and abusive marriages and social propriety must be raised. The author also directs attention to the perils of relying too much on myths or majoritarian politics without using common sense- both are bound to fail miserably.The trope of qabar, which means grave, is how Meera raises the questions of justice and the trauma of communal conflicts. The translation of the novel comes at a time when India witnesses waves of hatred and communal conflict every other day. This is similar to how despite the end of the British rule in India, the communal strife persists and has worsened over time.—————————————————————————————————————————————QabarAuthor: K R MeeraPublication: Eka, Westland Publications Private Limited, 2022Price: Rs 638 (approx) ","K R Meera’s 'Qabar', translated from Malayalam by Nisha Susan, is a personal revelation of a woman fighting against patriarchal forces and a political commentary .The magic realism, occult, myths, and the quest for love and justice in a country becoming highly communal with each passing day are meticulously interwoven .",https://kathmandupost.com/art-culture/2022/06/25/the-perils-of-communal-strife-and-abusive-marriage,Kathmandu Post,Culture & Arts ,6/25/2022 8:43
606,"After rift with Yadav, Bhattarai renews bid to set up ‘socialist centre’","On Sunday morning earlier this week, CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal said at a function that an environment is being developed for the former Maoists to come together. Later in the same day, Dahal, reached the residence of Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, where he held a meeting with Baburam Bhattarai, a former Maoist leader and currently the federal council chair of the Janata Samajbadi Party, according to at least two leaders familiar with the development, Vice President Pun is also a former Maoist leader. Dahal and Bhattarai led the “people’s war” from 1996 to 2006. Both maintained a close relationship, with Dahal as the leader of the masses and Bhattarai as an ideologue. Nonetheless, they had a fair share of bitterness—on one occasion in 2004, Dahal even initiated punitive action against Bhattarai.After the end of the war, the Maoists joined mainstream politics. Immediately after the promulgation of the constitution, the two leaders drifted apart. Bhattarai launched his own party—Naya Shakti. But it failed. He merged his party with Upendra Yadav’s Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum Nepal to form the Samajbadi Party Nepal. Dahal over the years has seen many of the leaders from war days deserting the Maoist party. Whether Bhattarai and Dahal will come together again may be a matter of speculation, that both face some sort of a crisis is a fact. Dahal may have got some boost after some significant wins in the recently concluded local elections, but he is increasingly burdened by the “Maoist” tag in his party. Bhattarai, on the other hand, could not secure any win in his own constituency, Gorkha, for his party in the local elections, and appears desperate to recoup his political career. Leaders close to Dahal and Bhattarai said that the duo dwelt on the possibility of forming a “socialist centre,” a concept the latter has been floating for quite a while. Unlike Dahal’s idea of bringing all the Maoist leaders together, Bhattarai has been calling for a Socialist Centre of “like-minded” people. According to leaders close to Bhattarai, he had taken serious steps around a year ago towards the formation of such a socialist centre and after the invalidation of the Nepal Communist Party, he had said the need for a socialist centre had become even more significant. “My request to comrades of various communist parties in Nepal: why has the objective of ending all kinds of repression and discrimination against people by people taken a regressive path?” Bhattarai wrote on Twitter in August last year. “How will we reach a new destination by pursuing the same old path? Shall we march towards a new direction with new ideas.”Bhattarai had held several rounds of discussions for the formation of the socialist centre with Dahal, Madhav Nepal and Upendra Yadav before the local polls so as to give a message to the country.But since all the three leaders were part of the coalition and planning to fight local polls under an alliance, the idea failed to gain momentum. “Bhattarai is still committed to forming a socialist centre but other leaders do not seem to be ready for it,” said Bishwadeep Pande, a central committee member of the Janata Samajbadi Party, who has been a close aide to Bhattarai for many years. “I don’t think the idea of socialist centre will gain traction until the upcoming elections.”According to Pandey, new dynamics could emerge after the polls depending upon the parties’ performance.Bhattarai is currently seeking to part ways with Yadav, which will mean a vertical split in the Janata Samjabadi. Whether Bhattarai wants to lead the Janata Samajbadi by claiming a majority or wants to make a renewed pitch for a socialist centre is not quite clear though.Dahal may be not quite hesitant to shed the Maoist tag from the party, but whether his party members would agree is also a question if a socialist centre idea gets traction. Maoist members still believe the “communist” tag is still attractive when it comes to the vote base.Bhattarai, however, does not seem to have any faith in the so-called “communist movement” as he believes the world has moved ahead. Had Dahal not been able to assert himself in the party from the eighth general convention and if the Maoist party had failed in local elections, there could have been some activities towards bringing the former Maoist leaders together, insiders say. “Bhattarai’s experiment with a party that lacked a communist tag failed but Dahal somehow managed to revive his significance,” said Yubaraj Chaulagain, a central member of the Maoist Centre. “Therefore, it's Bhattarai, who should compromise and even if the two parties decide to merge shedding the Maoist tag, Bhattarai will have to accept the communist tag.”According to Chaulagain, the degree of acceptance of Bhattarai as their leader among Maoist members is very low. “Chances of Dahal and most of the party leaders accepting Bhattarai’s proposal to shun the communist tag are slim,” he said. “Now Bhattarai has already lost his significance in Nepali politics and his popularity is fading fast.”Ever since he left the Maoist party, Bhattarai has been talking about five principles—sovereignty, inclusiveness, good governance, prosperity and remodelled socialism.He had made these the core values of his Naya Shakti Party. Bhattarai believes all the existing communist forces should come under the one umbrella of “socialist centre.” According to Bhattarai, he decided to quit the Maoist party after Dahal rejected the former’s proposal to transform the party into a socialist party. “Since then, I have been pressing him for the same at every meeting and the same discussions continued during our latest meeting on Sunday,” Bhattarai told the Post. “I have been asking him to shed the Maoist and the communist tags, but he wants me to accept the communist tag.”Bhattarai came up with the idea of setting up a socialist centre to develop a two-party system in the country—one led by Nepali Congress, a liberal democratic capitalist force, and the other a strong democratic socialist force of the existing communist parties. “Instability in Nepali politics will persist unless the so-called communists turn into socialist forces and bring clarity and consistency as well as a focussed programme,” said Bhattarai. “But both the Maoists and the UML are not ready to embrace the idea because their brands are still popular. But the two communist forces won’t last for long.”He said the existing setup will continue until the next polls leading the country to political instability for another five years, and only then will the people and the parties understand his concept. “I think the parties and the people will understand my concept only after another five years of political instability,” said Bhattarai.  ","Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Baburam Bhattarai led the ‘people’s war’ from 1996 to 2006 .Both maintained a close relationship, with Dahal as the leader of the masses and Bhattarai as an ideologue .After the end of the war, the Maoists joined mainstream politics .",https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/06/25/after-rift-with-yadav-bhattarai-renews-bid-to-set-up-socialist-centre,Kathmandu Post,Politics ,6/25/2022 7:27
605,Government slashes prices of petroleum products amid concerns about rising inflation,"The government has decided to slash the prices of petroleum products.Commerce and Supplies Minister Dilendra Prasad Badu said at a press conference on Saturday afternoon that the government has reduced prices of the petroleum products. The price of petrol has been reduced by Rs20 per litre. Similarly, the price of diesel has been reduced by Rs29 per litre.As per the new decision, petrol now will cost Rs 179 per litre and diesel will cost Rs163 per litre.The new decision will come into effect from Saturday midnight. The move follows instructions from the House committee on Friday and a meeting of the coalition partners on Saturday to revise the prices of petroleum products, saying inflation was taking a toll on the general public.The government was instructed to slash various taxes imposed on petroleum products.After the latest hike in prices, petrol price has gone up to Rs199 per litre. Diesel and kerosene price has risen to Rs192 per litre. On Sunday night, Nepal Oil Corporation jacked up prices—Rs21 in petrol and Rs27 in diesel and kerosene. According to Nepal Oil Corporation, the government levies Rs65.61 in taxes on every litre of petrol sold at Rs199. It collects Rs49.53 on every litre of diesel sold at Rs192. The government also collects Rs10 as infrastructure tax in each liter of petrol and diesel sold. During Saturday’s meeting senior leader of the Nepali Congress Ram Chandra Poudel urged coalition leaders to take immediate action to control the prices of commodities because it has started to take a toll on the general public. Saturday’s meeting was attended by Nepali Congress President and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Nepal, Janata Samajbadi Party chair Upendra Yadav and Congress senior leader Poudel. Four ministers, including Badu, were also present.“Today's coalition meeting has decided to direct the government to cut the prices of petroleum products to control inflation and provide relief to the public,"" said Ramesh Malla, chief personal secretary to CPN (Maoist Centre) Chair Dahal. He said that the coalition meeting then asked the government to take a decision on slashing the prices of the petroleum products. On Friday, the Industry, Commerce, Labour and Consumer Welfare Protection Committee of Parliament had directed the government to slash the taxes on petroleum products by half.

603,Myanmar’s Suu Kyi moved to solitary confinement in jail: Military,"Myanmar military authorities have transferred deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi to a prison in the capital from an undisclosed location where she had been held since she and her government were ousted in a coup last year, a military spokesman said.The Nobel laureate, who turned 77 on Sunday, had been moved to the jail in Naypyitaw on Wednesday after court rulings against her, military spokesman Zaw Min Tun said.“She was transferred to prison under the law and is being kept in solitary confinement,” he said in a statement.Suu Kyi has been charged with about 20 criminal offences carrying a combined maximum jail term of nearly 190 years since she was toppled by the military in February 2021, including multiple counts of corruption. She denies all charges.The BBC’s Burmese-language service cited sources as saying Suu Kyi was being held in a separate building inside the prison in Naypyitaw.A source familiar with her cases told Reuters on Wednesday that all legal proceedings against Suu Kyi would be moved to a courtroom in the jail.Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing had previously allowed Suu Kyi to remain in detention at an undisclosed location, despite convictions for incitement and several minor offences.Reuters could not reach Suu Kyi or her representatives for comment. Her lawyers have been barred from speaking about her cases. A spokesperson for the junta did not respond to requests for additional comment.Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar’s independence hero, was first put under house arrest in 1989 after huge protests against decades of military rule. In 1991, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for campaigning for democracy but was only fully released from house arrest in 2010.She swept a 2015 election, held as part of tentative military reforms that were brought to a halt by last year’s coup.Western countries have called the charges against Suu Kyi and her convictions a sham and demanded her release. The military says she is being given due process by an independent judiciary.Trial in prisonMyanmar Witness, a non-governmental group that documents human rights, issued satellite imagery of what it said were recently constructed buildings next to the main prison compound in Naypyitaw.The Mizzima news portal also showed a photograph of a one-storey building in the jail that it said was being used in connection with Suu Kyi.Reuters could not independently confirm whether any of the buildings were being used for the trial or to house Suu Kyi or other detained members of her National League for Democracy party.Australian economist Sean Turnell, previously an adviser to Suu Kyi, who has been charged with violating a state secrets law, had also been moved to the Naypyitaw jail, media reports said. Suu Kyi also faces charges over breaches of the secrets law.Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, in a statement on June 10, said Canberra rejected the court decision to prosecute Turnell.US-funded Radio Free Asia cited sources saying the trial of Suu Kyi and Turnell started on Thursday in the jail.Authorities had reinforced prison fences and tightened security since Suu Kyi had been moved there, RFA reported.Suu Kyi had not been allowed to bring the household staff who had accompanied up during her detention and had decided not to bring her dog, Taekido, BBC Burmese reported.Suu Kyi’s court proceedings have taken place behind closed doors with only limited information reported by state media.It is not clear how much Suu Kyi knows of the crisis in her country, which has been in chaos since the coup, with the military struggling to consolidate power and facing increasing opposition from insurgents.

602,"India inflation likely to exceed top of RBI band until December, governor says","India’s central bank is on course to bring down prices but the retail inflation rate is likely to remain above the top end of its mandated target band until December, Governor Shaktikanta Das said in an article in the Times of India on Friday.“We are well on track to bring down inflation and inflation expectations. Until December, CPI is expected to remain higher than the upper tolerance level. Thereafter, it is expected to go below 6 percent as per our current projections,” Das said.Retail inflation eased marginally in May, after touching an eight-year high of 7.79 percent in April, but remained above the central bank’s tolerance band of 2-6 percent for a fifth month in a row.Das said despite current inflation being driven by supply-side factors, monetary policy still plays an important role when inflation rises since household price expectations are backward-looking.“Inflation expectations influence not only households but also businesses and drive up pricing of food, manufactured goods and services. If they expect inflation to be high, even companies will defer their investment plans,” he added.Das also said India’s economy is stable and continues to steadily recover from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.He said pressure on the rupee, which hit a record low of 78.39 against the dollar on Wednesday, was largely due to the monetary policy tightening in advanced economies to tackle high inflation.“In such a situation, there will be outflow of capital from emerging market economies. It is happening across emerging market economies. This is nothing but the spillover of the monetary policy actions in advanced economies,” he said.But added that India’s foreign exchange reserves are quite strong at around two-and-half times the country’s short-term foreign debt and the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals are far better than many other countries.India’s monetary policy committee (MPC) raised rates by 50 basis points earlier this month, after a 40-bps increase in May, to prevent growing inflationary pressure from becoming broad-based. Further hikes are expected in coming months.

601,New Chinese international department head holds talks with Oli and Dahal,"Liu Jianchao, the new head of the International Liaison Department of Communist Party of China, held talks with CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Oli and on Wednesday and Thursday. Liu replaced Song Tao recently. Song also maintained a close relationship with the Nepali communist leaders and used to hold frequent conversations with them. Liu was formerly the chief spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the former director-general of its Information Department. On June 23 and 24, Liu, Minister of the International Liaison Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held video calls with Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) and former prime minister Prachanda and Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and former prime minister Oli, respectively, according to a Communist Party of China (CPC) statement. The virtual talks take place at a time when some sections of both party leaders are engaged in attempts to form a left alliance or forge some kind of agreement for the upcoming federal and parliamentary elections. Though there are attempts going on to hold talks between Oli and Dahal, there is no concrete progress yet, said party leaders. His predecessor Song has also visited Kathmandu twice and maintained good contacts with the leaders of both communist party leaders. During the height of controversy over the Millenium Challenge Corporation Nepal Compact in February, Song had held several rounds of talks with Oli and Dahal. A junior leader of the CPC liaison office also held talks with the CPN (Unified Socalist) chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and others.The conversation took place just two days after the Nepal government decided not to move ahead with the United State’s State Partnership Program. China, which was against the ratification of the MCC Compact, on Thursday said it commends Nepal’s decision not to move ahead with the SPP. Liu Jianchao, the new head of the International Liaison Department of Communist Party of China  Photo Courtesy: AFPSpeaking at a regular press briefing, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China’s Foreign Ministry, said that as a friendly and close neighbour and strategic cooperative partner, China commends the Nepali government’s decision [not to move ahead with the SPP.]Liu said that China and Nepal are friendly neighbours linked by mountains and rivers, as well as development partners with a shared future, the statement reads. It also recalls Chinese President and CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping’s “historic visit” to Nepal in October 2019.“China-Nepal relations have been upgraded to a strategic partnership of friendship for generations, oriented towards development and prosperity, entering a new era of rapid development,” Liu said per the statement. “China is willing to work with Nepal to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, deepen political mutual trust, actively promote major projects and practical cooperation in various fields under the framework of the Belt and Road, and push the friendship across the Himalayas to a new height.”These are the first virtual talks between Nepali leaders and Liu after he assumed office in early June.Confirming the talks, Ramesh Malla, personal assistant to Dahal said that the party chair congratulated Liu for his appointment as the new head of International Liaison Department.“The Chinese side told the chairman that China supports Nepal’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence and is ready to deepen bilateral cooperation between the two nations. Dahal assured the CPC about Nepal’s unflinching commitment towards one-China policy. And the Chinese side also offered to take forward the relationship between the two parties in a strategic way,” said Malla.Liu said that the CPC and the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the CPN-UML have similar concepts and feelings, and are willing to strengthen inter-party exchanges, promote party to party cooperation, enhance people-to-people bonds, and respect each other's core interests and major concerns while playing a role in promoting the healthy and stable development of China-Nepal relations, according to the statement.“In the second half of this year, the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will be held to draw a blueprint for China's development in the next stage, and it will certainly provide new impetus for the development of China-Nepal relations,” the statement added.During the meeting, according to the statement, Dahal and Oli said that the friendship between Nepal and China is ever-lasting.“The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) and the Communist Party of Nepal-UML give top priority to relations with China and the Communist Party of China, and will never allow any force to use Nepalese territory to engage in anti-China activities,” the statement added.After the meeting, the Chinese representatives also signed a memorandum of exchange and cooperation between the two parties and the CPC.The major achievements and historical experience of the CPC’s century-long struggle have provided important inspiration and reference for the Nepalese political party, the statement reads.Malla said that the memorandum of understanding signed between the two sides was about exchange programmes of party leaders and cadres between the two parties including sharing experiences with each other which they are doing with several communist and non-communist parties.The CPN (Maoist Center) and the Communist Party of Nepal-UML are willing to strengthen cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party in areas such as the joint construction of the “Belt and Road”, and promote the long-term and stable development of Nepal-China relations. We look forward to and wish the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China a complete success, the statement added.  ","Liu Jianchao, the new head of the International Liaison Department of Communist Party of China, held talks with CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Oli .Liu replaced Song Tao recently .Song also maintained a close relationship with the Nepali communist leaders and used to hold frequent conversations with them .",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/24/new-chinese-international-department-head-holds-talks-with-oli-and-dahal,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/24/2022 21:06
600,Kathmandu Metropolitan City unveils Rs25.41 billion budget for new fiscal year,"The biggest metropolis of the country, Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Friday unveiled a budget of Rs 25.41 billion for the fiscal year 2022-23. This is an increase by over six billion rupees from last year’s Rs 18.9 billion. Kathmandu’s budget was presented by City’s deputy mayor, Sunita Dangol, at its 11th municipal assembly and Lalitpur’s annual budget was presented by Lalitpur’s mayor, Chiri Babu Maharjan. Like earlier years, Kathmandu this year also has given more emphasis to infrastructure development. Dangol has allocated 49.57 percent of the total budget or 11.08 billion for infrastructure development. Likewise, Rs4.68 billion has been set aside for running the City’s offices and Rs 4.46 for good governance related programmes. The deputy mayor said the City will give priority to restoration and maintenance of historical stone spouts and monuments and construction of falchas (traditional public rest houses) at various bus stations. Dangol has also given emphasis to retrofitting the 2015 earthquake-damaged historical Bagdurbar [palace]. The previous mayor, Bidya Sundar Shakya, had drawn widespread criticism after giving approval to demolish the quake-damaged palace. The City also plans to restore Dabali (traditional open spaces) and construct an amphitheatre. Similarly, the city has also announced plans to segregate garbage at source and convert ‘waste to energy’ in an attempt to solve the garbage problem. This time the City has also allocated funds for women empowerment job policies, self-employment programmes for differently abled people, and e-libraries. Also, Dangol has allocated a budget for the Nepali Folk Musical Instrument Museum at Tripureshwar.Similarly, the neighbouring Lalitpur Metropolitan City also unveiled its annual budget on Friday totalling Rs6.35 billion, which is an increase by over 1 billion from last year. Lalitpur has announced plans to run a ‘call center’ to listen to public grievances.

599,US Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade abortion landmark,"The US Supreme Court on Friday took the dramatic step of overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion and legalized it nationwide, handing a momentous victory to Republicans and religious conservatives who want to limit or ban the procedure.The court, in a 6-3 ruling powered by its conservative majority, upheld a Republican-backed Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks. The vote was 5-4 to overturn Roe, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing separately to say he would have upheld the Mississippi law but not taken the additional step of erasing the precedent altogether.The justices held that the Roe v. Wade decision that allowed abortions performed before a fetus would be viable outside the womb - between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy - was wrongly decided because the US Constitution makes no specific mention of abortion rights.A draft version of the ruling written by conservative Justice Samuel Alito indicating the court was likely to overturn Roe was leaked in May, igniting a political firestorm. Friday’s ruling authored by Alito largely tracked his leaked draft.“The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision,” Alito wrote in the ruling.Roe v. Wade recognized that the right to personal privacy under the US Constitution protects a woman’s ability to terminate her pregnancy. The Supreme Court in a 1992 ruling called Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey reaffirmed abortion rights and prohibited laws imposing an “undue burden” on abortion access.“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division,” Alito added.Overturning Roe v. Wade has long been a goal of Christian conservatives and many Republican officeholders.By erasing abortion as a constitutional right, the ruling restores the ability of states to pass laws prohibiting it. Twenty-six states are seen as either certain or likely now to ban abortion. Mississippi is among 13 states already with so-called trigger laws designed to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned.The court’s three liberal justices - Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan - issued a jointly authored dissent.“Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens,” they wrote.As a result of Friday’s ruling, “from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A state can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs,” the liberal justices added.Crowds of anti-abortion activists, who had gathered outside the courthouse for days, erupted in cheers as news of the ruling spread.“I’m ecstatic,” said Emma Craig, 36, of Pro Life San Francisco. “Abortion is the biggest tragedy of our generation and in 50 years we’ll look back at the 50 years we’ve been under Roe v. Wade with shame.”House of Representatives Speaker Democrat Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, denounced the decision, saying that a “Republican-controlled Supreme Court” has achieved that party’s “dark and extreme goal of ripping away women’s right to make their own reproductive health decisions.”Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, appeared to nix the idea advocated by a number of anti-abortion advocates, that the next step is for the court to declare that the Constitution outlaws abortion nationwide. “The Constitution neither outlaws abortion nor legalizes abortion,” he wrote.Kavanaugh, a potentially pivotal vote in future abortion cases, also said that the ruling does not let states bar residents from travelling to another state to obtain an abortion, or retroactively punish people for prior abortions - actions protected by other constitutional rights.Mississippi’s law had been blocked by lower courts as a violation of Supreme Court precedent on abortion rights. Abortion is likely to remain legal in liberal states. More than a dozen states currently have laws protecting abortion rights. Numerous Republican-led states have passed various abortion restrictions in defiance of the Roe precedent in recent years.Before the Roe decision, many states banned abortion, leaving women who wanted to terminate a pregnancy with few options. As a result of Friday’s ruling, women with unwanted pregnancies in large swathes of America may face the choice of travelling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available, buying abortion pills online or having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion.Trump’s appointeesRepublican former President Donald Trump as a candidate in 2016 promised to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would reverse Roe. He was able to appoint three conservative justices - a third of the total - during his four years in office, moving the court rightward and building a 6-3 conservative majority. All three Trump appointees - Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - were in the majority in Friday’s ruling.Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only abortion clinic remaining in Mississippi, challenged the 2018 law and had the support of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration at the Supreme Court. The law allows abortions when there is a “medical emergency” or a “severe fetal abnormality” but does not have an exception for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.A federal judge in 2018 struck the law down, citing the Roe precedent. The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2019 reached the same conclusion.Leak investigationRoberts denounced the May 2 leak of Alito’s draft opinion in the case and announced an investigation to identify the culprit. Supreme Court leaks are extremely rare, especially concerning internal deliberations before a ruling is issued. Following the leak, Biden condemned the overturning of Roe as a “radical” step and urged Congress to pass legislation protecting abortion access nationally.Thousands of people rallied for abortion rights in Washington and other cities after the leak, including some protesters at the homes of some conservative justices. A California man armed with a handgun, ammunition, a crow bar and pepper spray was arrested near Kavanaugh’s Maryland home on June 8 and charged with attempted murder.The justices in 2016 struck down a Texas law imposing strict regulations on abortion facilities and doctors. The justices in 2020 struck down a Louisiana law that similarly placed restrictions on doctors who perform abortions. But the court has become more conservative in recent years with the addition of three appointees made by former President Donald Trump.Since 2018, the court lost two champions of abortion rights. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in 2020, being replaced by Barrett, who as an academic before joining the judiciary signalled support for overturning Roe.Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative who sometimes sided with the liberal justices on social issues such as abortion and LGBT rights, retired in 2018 and was replaced by Kavanaugh. Kennedy was part of the majority in the 1992 decision and voted to strike down the Texas abortion restriction in 2016.Gorsuch in 2017 replaced the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who was an abortion opponent.Opinion polls show a majority of Americans support abortion rights. But overturning Roe has been a goal of anti-abortion activists and Christian conservatives for decades, with annual marches in Washington including in January of this year.The number of US abortions increased by 8 percent during the three years ending in 2020, reversing a 30-year trend of declining numbers, according to data released on June 15 by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supporters abortion rights.The US abortion rate peaked in 1980, seven years after the Roe ruling, at 29.3 abortions per 1,000 women of child-bearing age - 15-44 - and stood at 13.5 per 1,000 in 2017 before increasing to 14.4 per 1,000 women by 2020. In 2020, there were 930,160 US abortions, with 20.6 percent of pregnancies ending in abortion in 2020, up from 18.4 percent in 2017. Mississippi experienced a 40 percent increase in abortions performed from 2017 to 2020.Globally, abortion rights generally have been increasing. The UN World Health Organization said around 73 million abortions take place globally each year, including 29 percent of all pregnancies.

598,Misleading assertion,"We are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system."" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms.

596,Nepal face tough UAE in semis,"Nepal national women’s cricket team will face the United Arab Emirates in Friday’s semi-finals of the ACC Women’s Twenty20 Championship after the UAE thrashed Qatar women by 153 runs to top the Group ‘A’.The UAE needed a victory in their final group match to win the group and they deservedly did so after Esha Oza cracked 115 runs off 67 balls that featured 18 boundaries and three sixes at the Kinrara Academy Oval in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was her second career ton and the tournament’s first century in Malaysia.Oza was bowled by Saachi Dhadwal in the first ball of the 17th over but she had already done her part right off bat, sharing a 174-run partnership with Theertha Satish, who smacked 55 off 42 deliveries that included five fours.Kavisha Egodage then hit five fours in her 13-ball knock as the UAE posted a huge total of 214-1.In reply, Qatar, sent to field first after losing the toss, set out for an unlikely chase at the crease but lost wickets at regular intervals as an unstoppable UAE skittled them out for 61-7.Suraksha Kotte returned the match figures of 11-4. Saachi Dhadwal and Angeline Mare contributed 11 runs each for a helpless Qatar. Shrutiben Rana scored 10 runs.Nepal had dropped to second, behind Hong Kong, after succumbing to a seven-wicket defeat—their first loss in Group ‘B’ match—against the Group ‘B’ leaders on Tuesday.The loss against Hong Kong could prove a great setback to Rubina Chhetry’s team, who are struggling with batting inconsistencies on the pitch in Malaysia.Nepal’s highest total in the tournament was 109, against Hong Kong. Chhetry and Indu Barma have remained more stable with the bat compared to other Nepali batters but Nepal’s highest scorer in the championship, Chhetry, has managed just 87 in four matches, with her highest total (34 not out) coming against Kuwait women.On the contrary, three UAE top order batters have combined for a total of 353 runs in just three innings. Oza ton took her individual tally to 170 runs on Wednesday.With only two finalists qualifying for the ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup in Bangladesh, Nepal will need to pull off a big upset if they are to secure their place in the October finals.Hong Kong accumulated eight points to advance as group winners after defeating Kuwait by 30 runs, also on Tuesday.Hong set up a last four battle against hosts Malaysia women, who secured their spot in the semi-finals as runners-up with a 53-run win over Oman in the Malaysian capital.

595,Chrome OS for all! Rejuvenate older laptops,"As technology keeps moving forward, we continually create devices that turn redundant. With the release of Windows 11, these hardware redundancies have become more visible. The arbitrary requirements of Microsoft’s new operating system have given a lifetime to all unsupported devices. Support for Windows 10, although still active, will expire eventually, leaving a lot of computers running old, unsupported software. We can even see some modern computers or laptops struggling under Windows 10. While I have always recommended Linux as a viable alternative to Windows 10 on low-spec’d or older machines, a new solution by Google might just be a better solution.Google isn’t new to the operating system game, with Android being the most popular and accessible operating system on mobile devices. When it comes to laptops, they have their Chrome OS operating systems, the backbone of many Chromebooks. In 2022, Google’s Chrome OS has come a long way from their ‘browser as an operating system’ days; today, the operating system has developed into a robust system with external hardware support and even Android and Windows app support. And while Chrome OS has been an exclusive on Chromebooks, with the release of Chrome OS Flex, the operating system can be easily installed on any old Windows or Mac laptop. At its core, Chrome OS Flex is the complete Chrome OS package; it has all of Google’s proprietary services and even looks exactly like the systems on Chromebooks. This is not the first time Chrome OS has come to systems outside of Chromebooks; Neverware had released the CloudReady operating system based on the Chromium code back in 2015. However, Google’s own Chrome OS Flex is an official release of the operating system with all of Google’s bells and whistles and even official update support. Chrome OS Flex is a very lightweight operating system running with base system requirements of any Intel or AMD x86 or 64-bit processor, 4 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of internal storage. The operating system can run under such constrained requirements because of the nature of the operating system, and Chrome OS has been a very online-oriented operating system from its heyday. The system depends heavily on Google’s own online offerings like Google Drive, Docs, and Sheets. Although there are simple solutions for localised files, it is a system that doesn’t depend a whole lot on your hardware and more on web services. Compared to many Linux distributions that come with their own set of problems, installing Google Chrome OS Flex is very straightforward. It offers a live environment, much like other Linux Distros, and installs in a breeze. Chrome OS also has many media capabilities baked in, which would bring high-resolution YouTube or even Netflix support on older hardware, something the older CloudReady OS could not do. New updates to the OS have also integrated the Google ecosystem much better with support for Android apps and seamless integration with their localised apps. Unfortunately for Chrome OS Flex users, Android app support hasn’t made it to the Flex version of Chrome OS yet. The operating system, although lightweight, does have issues and doesn’t feel as polished. There are instances where certain buttons don’t work; the mute button and the volume control button glitch out from time to time, and there are plenty of weird UI issues as well. You might run into problems with Face ID, Windows Hello, or even fingerprint biometrics. But overall, it supports many external hardware and devices flawlessly. Regardless of the bugs, Chrome OS is a very lightweight operating system that can bring new life to your older PCs or even low powered systems struggling under Windows 10. It’s free if you want to give it a shot and can be easily booted into a flash drive. It can also run completely off of a pen drive if you want a portable implementation of the operating system. If you like what you see in the live environment, you can install it on your hard drive. You can easily create a bootable flash drive for Chrome OS Flex through the ‘Chromebook Recovery Utility' extension of Chrome browsers. With the entry of Chrome OS on third-party hardware, a very viable alternative to Windows and Linux has made its way into the market. While Linux remains a solid choice if you want stability and expandability, Chrome OS Flex is for those who don’t want to experiment or tinker around with their operating systems too much. Easy to install and easy to use, the Flex seems like the perfect simple alternative for people who just want a working computer.

594,Dining with a view in Bauddha,"Placed in the heart of Kathmandu, Bauddha stupa is a bustling area flocked by locals and tourists alike. The spiritual Buddhist atmosphere mingled with Tibetan cuisine and culture—against the backdrop of the iconic Bauddha stupa—has created Bauddha’s own unique image among domestic and international tourists. The overhead view of the stupa surrounded by Kathmandu’s concrete jungle is a scenery that captures the essence of Bauddha and the expansive view offered from Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant might be the one of the best ways to experience it. Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant is Hotel Tibet International’s rooftop restaurant and is located on the hotel’s seventh floor. The restaurant shares its space with another one of the hotel’s food and beverage outlets, the 7th Heaven Bar, while the other two eateries—Akama Café and Shambala Tea Garden—are located on the ground floor of the hotel. While the hotel itself was established in 2012, it took seven years for the stunning view of Bauddha offered from the rooftop of the hotel to be combined with a dining experience.“Initially, the hotel’s restaurant was located on the first floor but we felt that the need of the hour was to set up a restaurant on the rooftop which offered a marvellous view,” says Pradhyumna Ghimire, chief operating officer of Hotel Tibet International.So in 2019, the restaurant officially opened its door with the name Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant. The ambiance of the restaurant goes hand in hand with the overall Tibetan cultural theme of the Hotel Tibet International. The enormous seven-storied hotel features an impressive architecture speckled with intricate Tibetan motifs and symbolisms. Staff throughout the hotel, including the ones in Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant, wear traditional Tibetan attire and follow Tibetan greetings and customs. The main idea behind the formation of the hotel was to recreate a feeling of being in Tibet, says Ghimire.While Tibetan culture is in prominence throughout the hotel, the Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant isn’t purely focused on Tibetan cuisine but features a multi cuisine experience. Six months ago, the menu went through a complete redesign based on the visions of Ghimire and executive chef of the restaurant Purushotam Adhikari. The menu is now divided into categories of four distinct cuisines: Tibetan, Continental, Chinese/Thai and North Indian. There are also four head chefs who oversee their own category of cuisine; Sanu Tamang for Tibetan, Ram Bahadur Thapa for Chinese/Thai, Jameel Ahmed for North Indian, and the executive chef Adhikari himself heads the Continental cuisine since it’s his area of culinary expertise.“A common misconception among people is that the hotel is only built for Tibetan guests or that it only caters to the Tibetan crowd,” says Ghimire. “What we do is create an experience that focuses upon Tibetan culture but our menu design reflects our aspiration to cater to both local and international crowds of customers.”Ripiene Involtini Di Pollo and Paneer steak are two of the most popular dishes on the menu. Costing Rs895 and Rs695 respectively (excluding taxes), the two dishes hail from the category of Continental cuisine. “Ripiene Involtini Di Pollo is prepared by stuffing a hollowed out chicken boneless breast with spinach, mushroom, parmesan cheese, red capsicum, fresh herbs (basil, rosemary), salt, and pepper. The chicken breast is then marinated, sauteed and cooked in the oven,” says Purushotam Adhikari. Purushotam Adhikari, the executive chef of Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant, has been working in the food industry for three decades and specialises in continental cuisine. Elite Joshi/TKPThe dish is a filling and enjoyable dish, its mushroom sauce being the highlight of the dish which combines the overall flavours in the dish. For vegetarians, the Paneer Steak is a favoured option. It’s a simple dish as the paneer is simply seasoned with salt and pepper and pan-fried then cooked in the oven, but the pesto sauce, the base of the dish, helps create a simple yet satisfying dish.‘Honey Noodles with Ice-cream’ and ‘Roasted Nuts Dates Crispy Pancake’ are the dessert items not to be missed in the menu, while ‘Khasi ko Bhutuwa Kebab’, ‘Jhaneko Duck Choila’, and ‘Kali Daal Makhani’ appeal to the local palate.“Our most popular Tibetan dish is the Gyakok, a Tibetan hotpot. The dish becomes the talk of the town especially during winters,” says Ghimire. “We also of course have signature dishes of the Tibetan community like thukpa, thenthuk, shabril, phingsha, etc., in the menu.”While the core area of Bauddha attracts the kind of crowd which craves for local, authentic taste of Tibetan food like momos, shabaley, laphing, and keema noodles, there is an emerging trend of crowds who care not only the taste of the food but also the ambiance of the restaurant, the available scenery, and the overall hygiene of the food.In the case of sanitation, the restaurant has spared no effort to create a high level of hygienic food standard. As one enters the restaurant, the sight of the open kitchen becomes unmissable, from where one can see exactly how the ingredients are kept and the food is prepared.“We have our own SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and we have taken the concept of HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points, a management system to ensure food safety through various stringent steps) and recreated their standards,” says Ghimire. “Our priority is to serve our guests good, authentic, and hygienic food.”The restaurant is still reeling from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic but the road ahead brims with hope as events and gatherings ease back into their normal routines and frequency.“During the pandemic, events like marriage went ahead in limited capacity but many other occasions like anniversaries, bratabandha, and corporate events were put on hold,” says Ghimire. “Now that things are returning to normalcy, all of the events that were put on hold are now flooding the hospitality industry which is a good sign.”The pandemic-induced lockdowns forced many hospitality industries to realign their customer approach with many of them focusing instead on the local crowds, an approach adopted by Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant as well.“People might have the perception of Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant as being expensive but once they visit and experience the level of service and the ambiance, the quality of food, and enjoy the view, they feel that the value is worth the price,” asserts Ghimire.Ghimire has also seen a trend emerging in the type of international tourists visiting the Boudhha area, which has made him more hopeful for the area’s hospitality industry in the long-run.“Before the pandemic, two segments of international tourists, MICE(Meeting Incentive Conference and Exhibitions) and adventure/expedition segments, were really growing,” says Ghimire. “We aren’t able to predict where the trends of tourism will head but the hustle and bustle of the Thamel area for international tourists has definitely dissipated and one of the areas where it has shifted is the Bauddha area.” ","Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant is Hotel Tibet International’s rooftop restaurant .The restaurant shares its space with another one of the hotel’s food and beverage outlets, the 7th Heaven Bar .Staff throughout the hotel, including the ones in Norbulingka Terrace Restaurant, wear traditional Tibetan attire and follow Tibetan greetings and customs .",https://kathmandupost.com/food/2022/06/09/dining-with-a-view-in-bauddha,Kathmandu Post,Food ,6/10/2022 7:57

Last year it started on June 11. A normal monsoon, supported by the timely arrival of rain, translates into favourable conditions for agricultural production, mainly of paddy, and is further linked with the country’s overall economic growth. However, the shortage of chemical fertilisers this year could offset any potential gains from the monsoon, economists have said.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.Meteorologists have forecast above-normal rains this monsoon.

590, ‘Lori’s’ success has made my mother happy and hopeful about my career’ ,"Scriptwriter and director Abinash Bikram Shah recently made headlines after his film ‘Lori: Melancholy of my mother’s lullabies’ won Special Mention of the Jury at the 75th edition of the Cannes film festival. The film, which was one of the nine short films selected out of 3,507 films for the The Short Film Palme D'or’ category, deals with child marriage and the overarching influence of patriarchy in such marriages. Its synopsis reads, “A mother sings lullabies to her 12-year-old daughter in order to calm her down. But, when the lullabies end, and the daughter comes to her senses, the reality turns out to be much grimmer, and life-altering.”Shah, who returned back to Nepal a week ago after the end of the Cannes Film Festival and his visit to Greece, is currently working on a project with Min Bahadur Bham, one of the most acclaimed Nepali film directors. He is also planning to shoot his first feature film ‘Elephants in the Fog’ from 2023. He sat down with the Post’s Shranup Tandukar to discuss his experiences in Cannes, the production of ‘Lori’, and what the film’s success means to him.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.How was the process of applying for the Cannes?Actually Sandeep Badal(production designer of ‘Lori’) encouraged me to submit the film for Cannes. At that time, I was in the US for a residency programme and I didn’t have time to submit, so Sandeep submitted the film. We simply went into the website and it was a free submission. We just had to write a logline, provide details of the team members, and then upload the film.Thousands of short films are submitted every year to Cannes, and I was doubtful of even submitting the film. I wasn’t really confident of trying but Sandeep encouraged and pushed me to submit the film and thankfully it all turned out well. There was a little bit of hope as one always has some hope for one’s works but filmmakers all over the world send their short films to Cannes so with the intense level of competition, I didn’t have high hopes for the success of ‘Lori’.I guess that is the thing for most people in the art field. There is always a sense of doubt regarding one’s creation. I thought my film was only decent but after the film got selected, I got a sense of validation that I was on the right track. And after winning the award itself, I was encouraged to keep continuing with my filmmaking journey.Did you start shooting ‘Lori’ with an aim to submit it to international film festivals?No, a Hong Kong-based production company called Petra Films had funded the film. They had funded a total of four films in Nepal, which were initially feature-length. Originally they had planned to showcase these films on their own platform but after the completion of this film, the production company had some internal issues and everything was stalled. So, we just decided to trim the film down to a short film length, submit it to film festivals and see how things go.We started the submission process with Cannes, much like most filmmakers. The way the popular international film festivals’ are scheduled means that Cannes is the first one to occur. The order goes like this: Cannes, then Venice, then Locarno, then Berlin. We were lucky that the film got selected in Cannes itself.When we talked last time, you had mentioned that all your writings come from a personal place. For ‘Lori’, what was the inspiration?When I was a child, my father used to live in Tarai and my mother lived in Kathmandu. I studied here in Kathmandu but for my vacations and holidays, I would travel to Tarai and during those visits, I got a chance to witness Tarai’s vibrant culture. Unfortunately, my father passed away when I was in grade 10. After that, I was raised by my mother and I had only sisters so I was raised in an environment where I was surrounded by female relatives. Maybe the inspiration for the film also came from this experience.But the main inspiration for the film was what I had seen and experienced myself during my childhood. When I was a kid, my friend got married when she was a child. Her wedding took place in a village far from ours and I still remember going for the marriage procession with my father. Throughout the years, I witnessed many more child marriages like this. Then again in recent years, I read another news article about child marriage somewhere in Nepal. It was the same situation when I was a child decades ago and it’s still prevalent now. So, I had thought why not make a film on this issue.Also, I have seen my mother and her struggles. There is hopelessness yet there’s also unyielding courage underneath that hopelessness for females in Nepal. After my father passed away, my mother raised me alone and I have witnessed the level of sheer resilience and strength she has shown throughout the years yet there was always the suffocating blanket of patriarchy looking to oppress her. Maybe that’s the reason why I wrote ‘Lori’. I don’t know if I have embedded a part of me in this story but this story did come from somewhere inside me and from my experiences.I feel like my experiences growing up with my mother and sister always somehow influences and permeates my stories and writings. I don’t think about including my personal experiences in a conscious way but it always gets blended into my stories one way or the other.The aspect ratio for the film is different. It's square-shaped and it induces an uncomfortable feeling of restriction. Was there any special reason behind this choice?The aspect ratio for this film is 1:1 and there are two reasons why this choice was made. The first one was that it reflects the headspace of the main character who is about to be married away and feels confined. Most films in Nepal have a wide aspect ratio and there’s beauty conveyed through this but its overuse is one of the problems in Nepali films. The other reason was to symbolise a sense that the audiences are looking into the experiences and culture of a community through a window. Initially, in the pre-production phase, we had actually decided against using 1:1 ratio for the film. It was going to be released on an online platform mainly targeting the Nepali audience so we wanted a conventional aspect ratio which would have a mainstream appeal for the audience. But later on, we tested out the 1:1 ratio and thought it was better after all.Our editor also suggested that we could do a 4:3 ratio instead of a square ratio but I thought that the 4:3 ratio, though it is limited too, was still a bit more open than a square ratio. I didn’t want to open the screen but close it off because that was a reflection of life. There are certain restrictions in life in the village where we shot the film. If the story was based in Kathmandu, then maybe I would have chosen a more open aspect ratio, but the main character in that cultural environment demanded a closed aspect ratio.The film garnered international success and appreciation. Do you think this will herald a positive change for the Nepali filmmaking industry?I don’t know about that. Maybe it will inspire Nepali filmmakers that they can also do the same but I don’t know if it can bring about reformation in our industry. It might take some time for such changes. But still, there are young filmmakers entering the industry who are doing amazing things. Right now, the kind of ‘creative films’ that we create are considered alternatives to ‘mainstream films’. But I believe that in the future, the roles will be reversed and ‘creative films’ will become mainstream. Have you received any response from the governmental agencies after you returned to Nepal?No, I haven’t been reached out by anyone in an official capacity. But I plan on reaching out to them myself as I heard that there are some governmental provisions which reimburse certain amounts of funds that were used to travel to international film festivals. My team members who joined me in Cannes had to spend their own personal funds so I am hoping to get the amount spent reimbursed, if possible.Lastly, how did your family respond to ‘Lori’s’ success in Cannes?My mother was ecstatic about its success in Cannes but I have a suspicion that rather than the actual success of ‘Lori’ in Cannes, she was more impressed by Priyanka Chopra giving a shout out to me for my success. ‘Lori’s’ success has made my mother happy and hopeful about my career. My mother’s validation, which I had been craving for years, was finally given to me by the success of ‘Lori’ and I will forever be grateful for this.

589,"Five women filmmakers to participate in Sheffield Docfest, UK’s leading documentary film festival ","Five Nepali women filmmakers (Aashruti Tripathy, Pinki Sris Rana, Prashansha KC, Prasuna Dongol, and Smriti Basnet) are set to attend Sheffield DocFest, UK’s leading documentary film festival and one of the world’s most influential markets for documentary projects, on June 23. The filmmakers will be looking to find potential investors for their projects and also network with filmmakers and stakeholders from across the globe. Under the initiation of British Council’s Gender Film Programme and led by Taskovski Films, UK, in collaboration with Nepal Female Filmmakers, Pame Film and Music Festival, and Film Development Board Nepal, the five filmmakers were also given intensive workshops through Taskovski Film docs connect training. “Our previous programme related to filmmaking gave out grants to women filmmakers to make films. But with this programme, which is the first of its kind for us, our aim is to create long-term impacts. With this programme, we want to let new emerging talents get access to international platforms and find their way through,” says Nischal Oli, Head of Arts at British Council Nepal. The whole programme was coordinated by Prasuna Dongol and Smriti Basnet, two of the five women filmmakers participating in the documentary film festival. “This collaboration with the British Council is a further step towards building a stronger documentary filmmaking base in Nepal.

588,The simple brilliance of the play ‘Chor ko Swor’,"The power of a play, as with other visual forms of art, is its ability to have multifaceted impacts. It can be a source of entertainment, a celebration of culture and traditions, an artful depiction of social issues, or an escape from reality. Once in a while, a play is produced that single-handedly achieves all these things.‘Chor ko Swor’, a play presented by Artmandu Nepal and staged at Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, is an example of such a play. The original story was written by Nabin Chauhan, while Anil Subba and Anwesh Thulung Rai adapted and co-directed the play. For a play to walk the fine line between riveting entertainment and subtle social depiction, many things need to come together. From the acting prowess of the artists to a creative set design to a captivating sound design, a play needs to encompass all these things to make the audience enjoy themselves while pushing them to reflect as well. ‘Chor ko Swor’ accomplishes this feat due to the sheer passion and hard work of all the theatre artists, creative team, and management team. The main theme in ‘Chor ko Swor’ revolves around marriage, specifically elopement in Nepal’s Limbu communities. Its namesake refers to a tradition in Limbu communities where relatives of the potential groom visit the potential bride’s parental house to inform them of the elopement and ask for their consent for the marriage. Bhimhang (played by Prabin Magar) has eloped with Seema (played by Nusa Lingden), and it sets off the start of the play. Bhimhang hails from Chemjong village, while Seema is from Sherma village. These two villages are connected by a shaky yet sturdy bridge, built with wood and bamboo. The relatives of Bhimhang traverse through this bridge to reach Sherma village to fulfil their duty as chor ko swor. As Seema’s family members and elders from the Sherma village reluctantly agree to the union, the marriage ceremony goes underway in all its extravagance.There’s a saying that makes a round in houses where people reach conventional marriage ages: You don’t marry a person, but you marry their whole family. In this play, however, a person doesn’t marry a family but the entire village. Geographically separated by a gorge, Chemjong and Sherma village have prominent differences even though both are settlements of Limbu communities. In terms of development also, these two villages differ: the boons of electricity and road have reached Chemjong village, while Sherma village still lags behind. While the residents of both villages had planned to build and connect the infrastructures together, in the end, only the Chemjong village flourished as they got electricity poles and roads. Like the shaky yet sturdy bridge that connects the two villages, marriage between members of the two villages is the bond that strengthens the relationship between the two similar yet different villages and buries residents’ old resentments.  Keshav Thapa/TKPThe play's ingenious set design adds to its authenticity and transports the audience through time and space to a rural setting in Nepal in the 2000s. A two-storied house belonging to Seema’s parents stands strong on the left side of the stage, while the bridge that connects the two villages is situated in the centre-back of the stage. The hard work and dedication of Hom BC and Surya KC, the duo who created the set, and the two directors who helped design the set shine bright throughout the play. The second story of Seema’s parental house is completely functional and is used creatively in the story, while the bridge itself is traversed by many people throughout the play. Even a water tap beside the house flows with real water, and a red light under a cauldron dims and glows to closely imitate actual wood fire. The efforts of the makers of the play to go the extra mile to add authenticity wherever possible is what makes this good play great.But the real beauty of this play lies in the things left unspoken and the things left hidden in plain sight. As the marriage ceremonies start, there is excitement and furore in the air. Pigs are slaughtered, traditional musicians are invited, and homemade alcohol is prepared. Women wash dishes, prepare alcohol, feed the guests, and clean the floors as men relish in the festivities. The marriage ceremony ends as the bride pays respect to the groom by touching his feet, but the groom is restrained by the relatives when he tries to do the same. When a playful teasing between soltis and soltinis takes centre stage, the bride and her sister-in-law converse together on the second floor of the house in the corner with grave faces, inaudible to the audience.This format of multiple actions occurring simultaneously is followed throughout the play. There are so many things happening concurrently that the audiences can quickly get confused on where to focus. On one side of the stage, there is a budding romance; on the other side, there is heartbreak as a bride leaves her parental house. But the confusion in these scenes adds to the nuances of reality and history. Our lives are often mixed with happy, sad, frustrating, and encouraging moments, and are rarely sequential.The play is also longer than usual, but its subject matter—the beginning of traditional marriage in a Limbu community till its end–warrants a two-hour running time. The scenes in the play which delve into the human emotions are given time to develop properly. When a sister and brother, who have avoided each other for years after the sister’s wedding, speak again, uncomfortable tension hangs in the air. Like snow and frost that sets in deep as winter progresses, there is a rigid iciness between the two siblings. It takes time for the snow to melt and for old familial relationships to thaw. The play gives ample time for such interactions to properly bloom, which in turn prolongs the play's running time. It’s a small inconvenience to pay for viewing a nuanced showing of family relationships.The end of the play comes full circle. The play, which started with the elopement of Bhimhang and Seema, ends with the elopement of Sesehang (played by Anil Subba) and Fungma (played by Bedana Rai). Now the residents of Sherma village make their way as chor ko swor to Chemjong village. While the play certainly shows the power imbalance between males and females in domestic life and marriage culture, it restrains from enforcing any suggestions or passing any judgement. It showcases life in the Limbu community’s rural setting in the 2000s in Nepal. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes, plays don’t have to make profound statements. Sometimes, plays can just be about weddings.‘Chor ko Swor’ is being staged at Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, until June 29.

587,Entrapped in their beauty ,"For the last few weeks, Thamel’s art galleries have seen a flurry of art exhibitions. One such gallery in Thamel that has an ongoing art exhibition is Dalai-La Art Space. Titled ‘Chen: Overlooked Reality’, this exhibition by Sushma Shakya, a visual artist from Patan, features 23 artworks and covers four series, all of which emphasise the old architecture of the Valley that integrated the philosophy of the five elements of nature: earth, fire, water, air and space (ether), and how harmful human activities damage the natural environment. Her series titled ‘Reverence for Newari Architecture’ features three miniature paintings—of a temple, a house, and a communal living set-up. The artwork’s canvas paper is embossed inconspicuously with an emblem of a close-knit Newa settlement with mountains in the background.In each of her artworks dating from 2017 to 2022, Shakya focuses on telling viewers how the old homes and temples of Kathmandu Valley were built by balancing the ecosystem. And by maintaining a balance with nature, the architecture also sought to give people contentedness. The thesis of her idea is that when chhen (home/house in Nepalbhasa) is built by maintaining the harmony of the five elements, it provides humans with an ideal environment to live in. In her series ‘Pancha Tattva’ (five elements), Shakya tries to illustrate how human activities disrupt the balance of nature’s five elements and exacerbated global warming and climate change. She incites that even the air we breathe has become unnatural. In her work titled ‘Mandala of Nature’, Shakya shows a plant—which is symbolic of life—at the centre of a mandala. The imagery perhaps is to remark the idea that the kind of life we lead determines the balance of nature. The artworks in the exhibition make it apparent that Shakya is influenced by Buddhism and has a particular fondness for the Valley’s old architecture, which placed a lot of emphasis on communal exchange. In many of her artworks, she tries to stress the design of bahas and bahis to highlight how they emphasise human relationships and the functionality of space. Shakya’s works featured in the exhibition are aesthetically pleasing. Her prints are beautiful, especially her work’ Reverence of Newari Architecture’. Her mixed media series ‘Overlooked Reality’ features three artworks, and they suitably highlight the fine craft of Newa architecture. However, grasping the meaning of all the artworks in the exhibition isn’t an easy task. Viewers will find it difficult to comprehend the concepts and logics Shakya’s artworks explore. It’s hard to follow the concept of the mandala and the five elements and imagine the balance of the five elements (the harmony she wants to emphasise with her works). And it is possibly because her works diverge time and again into different directions instead of converging to one particular idea. It’s difficult to see the five elements of nature embedded in her structures. When admiring the architecture of structures and settlements in her works, we are hardly thinking of the law of nature—which shouldn’t be the case as that is what the exhibition’s idea sits on. Unless we read the artist’s statement (written on a postcard), we cannot pinpoint the overlooked reality (which could be the five elements or just the old sustainable techniques of building houses) the exhibition is trying to explore. It does make sense to reminisce about old architecture in a world that is increasingly becoming concrete and replacing the nature of things. But we cannot overlook that five elements still continue to exist in the new architecture that surrounds us. The five elements are the law of existence itself, so the comparison of what we are missing in the architecture that surrounds us today and why the artist emphasises in five elements isn’t clear. The title of the exhibition itself, ‘Chen: Overlooked Reality’ misguides us to think of emotions and human/communal relations in reference to the word house. But it will be a surprise that ‘Chhen’ in the title doesn’t adhere to ‘home or house’ but simply architecture. What is missing in the exhibition is also humans and their interactions. And so, we keep looking at Shakya’s work from a distance as though we are only looking at photographs of house structures. Had the artist and the exhibition’s curator provided additional supporting information to make it easier for viewers to understand the artworks, the exhibition would have become more impactful. At this moment in the art scene, there is a dire need for artists and curators to work together to make it easier for viewers to enter their works and understand them, thereby inspiring them to explore more art. And it is not just detailed information about artworks that provides support to viewers to enter an exhibition’s experience; sometimes, it’s also about artists and curators rechecking, revising, and monitoring if they have enough artworks to say what they want to say with the exhibition. Perhaps, Shakya should have added some more artworks to establish people’s relation with the architecture she presents and the interaction of the five elements.Shakya’s ‘Chen: Overlooked Reality’ felt like it needed more artwork to say why the five elements matter and how humans, houses and the elements are interconnected. While the exhibition's overall theme is interesting, it fails to pull it off. ﻿‘Chen: Overlooked Reality’ will be on display until June 30 at Dalai-La Art Space in Dalai-La Boutique Hotel, Thamel.  ","'Chen: Overlooked Reality' features 23 artworks and covers four series .Each of Sushma Shakya's artworks dating from 2017 to 2022 focuses on telling viewers how the old homes and temples of Kathmandu Valley were built by balancing the ecosystem .In her series ‘Pancha Tattva’ (five elements), Shakya tries to illustrate how human activities disrupt the balance of nature’s five elements .",https://kathmandupost.com/arts/2022/06/22/entrapped-in-their-beauty,Kathmandu Post,Arts ,6/23/2022 7:51
586,How laphing made it to Kathmandu ,"Laphing is originally a Chinese dish. La means cold. Phing would signify the jelly-like texture of the snack. Popular in Tibet, laphing travelled to Nepal with the Tibetan refugees. The first time I tasted laphing, I found it delicious. It was sour and spicy. Laphing was the reason I was a regular at the old couples’.An old Tibetan couple here in Boudha who had a small eatery opposite Sherpa Gompa at Tushal first introduced me to ‘yellow laphing’. Soon I became friends with them. I got the idea of selling laphing from them.My name is Sonam Tenzing Lama. I have been living in Boudha for about 35-36 years now. My shop’s name is CD Laphing Center. I set up the shop in 2003. I sold and rented video CDs. Along with the CDs, I used to sell white laphing. Later on, with the growing internet access, CDs started to become outdated. Then I continued with laphing only.My mother came to Nepal along with her parents around 1959. Many Tibetans, in millions, fled Tibet after China quelled the uprising. She got married here. I was born here too. After my father’s death, we returned to Tibet. Life was scary in Tibet. We did not know what would happen to us. I was young. I didn’t care much. Adults, however, were scared. Momo was banned. We couldn’t travel afar. There were many restrictions. It was difficult for me to stay alone in Tibet after my mother passed away. I returned (to Nepal).I had heard that monasteries (in Boudha) offered food and shelter to refugees. I then decided (on my return) to live in a monastery. However, I could only find work for some wages at the monastery but couldn’t become a monk. I first met my wife at the monastery during a big ritual ceremony. She, like me, had also started working for the monastery. We fell in love and started a family, after which we left the monastery.We then rented a room with our savings. My wife started to work as domestic help. I travelled to Tatopani and other places to do business. It didn’t work as expected.People judge us for selling laphing. Although people love eating laphing, they don’t value us.We struggled in the past but we are happy now. We don’t have money to buy a house or car but we provide education and food for our children. I live with my wife, two daughters, and three sons.Many Tibetan refugees live here. Like us, they have to toil and figure out livelihood opportunities. There is no food without work. I think we will be happy if we get our country back. That’s all I think of.  ","Popular in Tibet, laphing travelled to Nepal with the Tibetan refugees .The first time I tasted laphing, I found it delicious.

584,Holidays at whim: That’s the way for local governments,"When it comes to declaring public holidays, Nepal’s federal government’s frivolity was evident from its recent decision to announce and then roll back the two-day weekend.After announcing Sundays as public holiday, besides the Saturdays, on April 26, in an apparent bid to reduce the consumption of petroleum products in the wake of rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves, the government on June 6 rolled back the decision. It faced criticism from various quarters for its flippant decision-making with many saying government officials tend to impose ideas without proper study.But such haphazard public holiday decisions are not limited to the federal government alone. Municipalities and rural municipalities over the years have come up with their own ways of declaring public holidays, at times with such reasons that defy logic, observers say.On Sunday, a rural municipality in Raipur of Rupandehi of Lumbini province declared a public holiday after a relative of its vice-chairperson died.Issuing a notice, Marchawari Rural Municipality chair Gaya Prasad Barai said that all government offices, schools and other organisations would remain closed to mourn the death of a brother-in-law of the rural municipality’s vice-chair Asha Singh.Singh’s “brother-in-law” died in a road accident on Sunday, says the notice.Expressing condolences to the family of the deceased, the rural municipality has said all schools, government offices and other organisations would remain closed on Sunday.Marchawari Rural Municipality is one of the 10 rural municipalities in Rupandehi district in Lumbini.According to its website, it is one of the most under-developed rural municipalities, with a population of 38,776 as per the national census 2011.“Since everyone from the rural municipality is going to attend the funeral, we decided to close the offices,” said Barai.On November 17 last year, Ramgopalpur Municipality in Mahottari of Madhesh Province decided to close all government offices and schools for a day because CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal was to inaugurate a function in the municipality as chief guest on that day. Issuing a notice a day before, then Mayor Ashok Kumar Mandal said since the Maoist chair and former prime minister Dahal would be inaugurating primary health centres in Wards 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, a public holiday had been declared for November 17.In August last year, Menchhayayem Rural Municipality in Tehrathum district declared closure of ward offices and schools for a day after the vice-chair's father-in-law died.According to onlinekhabar.com, the holiday was declared after Krishna Prasad Gautam, the father-in-law of vice-chair Gita Devi Timsina, died.Upon inquiry, the rural municipality’s chair Yadav Bahadur Khapung said he decided to announce the holiday as authorised by the Local Government Operation Act, the news website reported. “It is the vice-chairperson’s father-in-law whose house is close to the rural municipality office. Hence, the municipal officials will join the funeral procession,” he told onlinekhabar. “Hence, we announced a holiday.”When Rupani Rural Municipality in Saptari district declared a public holiday on May 22, it was not to mourn anyone’s death or welcome any politician from Kathmandu.It was to celebrate the victory of new office bearers of the municipality in the May 13 local elections.A notice issued by chief administrative officer Aravind Kumar Chaudhary said all government offices, schools, public institutions and health facilities “will remain closed, as per the order of the newly elected chair Dinesh Kumar Yadav, on May 22, to celebrate the victory of new office bearers in the May 13 elections”. Some local governments, however, have come under public scrutiny for various other outlandish reasons. Even though the federal government had announced a two-day holiday by publishing a notice in the Nepal Gazette, Gorkha’s Barpak Sulikot Rural Municipality decided not to follow the decision. Bishnu Bhatta, the rural municipality chair, said that a meeting decided to continue with public holidays on Saturdays only.According to the rural municipality, since schools had just resumed in-person classes after two years due to Covid-19, the decision to implement the two-day holiday was not justified.And there was yet another notice by a ward office in Khotang recently that caught people’s attention. The office of Ward 10 of Halesi Tuwachung Municipality sought to replace the female ward secretary with a male one.In a letter undersigned by Ward 10 Chairman Arjun Kumar Puri, it called for replacing Sushila Dahal, who had been working as ward secretary at Arkhaule ward office, with a male official citing “difficulties in providing services.” Dahal was appointed ward secretary after her predecessor was transferred to another office.The ward office, citing the decision of a ward committee meeting, said that since the ward is the biggest in the municipality in terms of area and population and has to deal with a massive workload following the election of new people’s representatives, including providing additional services including vital registration, and online distribution of social security allowance from Nawalpur once a week, “a female ward secretary cannot effectively deliver the services”.“As per the decision of the ward committee meeting held on June 14, we urge [the municipality] to make arrangements for a male ward secretary,” the letter reads. Although Nepal is among a few countries with a higher number of public holidays per year, some communities are still calling for adding a few more holidays for various occasions, including local festivals. Though local government representatives say they declare public holidays as authorised by Local Level Operations Act, there is no such provision per se, while it does authorise many decisions on its own. Khim Lal Devkota, a National Assembly member and expert on federalism, says he is not aware of any legal provision allowing local governments to announce holidays for any specific event.“Such authority should not be given to local governments as it would promote the culture of declaring holidays in a haphazard manner while people may be deprived of urgent and essential services,” Devkota told the Post.“I think provinces have been given certain rights to announce province-centric holidays considering the culture and tradition of particular communities in the province which is necessary too. Essentially, national standards should be followed on holidays.”The Local Government Operation Act-2017 does not specifically speak about the authority to declare holidays.According to Devkota, the trend of announcing holidays on the death of someone close to a local official or the arrival of a senior leader of a party would set a bad precedent. “It has not been many years since local governments came into being under the federal set-up,” said Devkota. “It is time to strengthen local governments and promote good governance practices.”Nepal became a federal republic through the 2015 constitution. The 2017 elections elected three tiers of government—federal, provincial and local. After completing the first cycle, local elections were held on May 13 to elect a new set of representatives. Prithvi Man Shrestha contributed reporting.

583,Potential foreign investors put off by Nepal’s lax law enforcement,"Potential foreign investors are not keen on putting money in Nepal’s information and technology sector because laws regarding cyber security and intellectual property rights are not enforced strictly here, industry insiders say.Foreign direct investment (FDI) pledges in the information and technology sector plunged 409 percent year-on-year in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year ended mid-June.According to the Department of Industry, Nepal received six small-scale FDI commitments in the information and technology sector worth Rs81.75 million in the review period. In the last fiscal year 2020-21, FDI commitments in this sector totalled Rs3 billion for 16 projects. Speaking at the Digital Nepal Conclave 2022 organised by ICT Foundation Nepal on Saturday, panellists said lax enforcement of regulations put off foreign investors.“There are no proper cyber security laws in the country. The intellectual property rights that are governed by the Copyright Act 2022 and the Patent, Design and Trademark Act 1965 are all outdated,” said Siddhant Raj Pandey, CEO of Business Oxygen, Nepal’s first private equity fund. “Nepal has become a risky country for foreign investors due to lack of laws,” he said. Pandey added that cyber security laws were very important to attract FDI.Participants in the conference also pointed out that the FDI rules change with every change in government, and the inconsistent policy was hurting FDI growth in Nepal.On May 23, 2019, the government raised the minimum foreign investment threshold to Rs50 million from Rs5 million despite reservations from the private sector.The budget for the next fiscal year 2022-23 unveiled on May 29 has again brought down the minimum threshold to Rs20 million.The reason given for the reduction is that the high threshold stopped the flow of FDI in small scale businesses. “The minimum threshold for foreign investment is still too high. This will keep potential investors away,” Pandey said.Cybercrimes are prosecuted under the Electronic Transaction Act 2008. The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology drafted a National Cyber Security Policy 2021 with the purpose of governing and addressing cyber security issues.The Nepal Telecommunications Authority passed the Cyber Security Bylaw 2020 which aims to protect information and communication systems from cyber attacks and other associated risks.Nepal moved up to the 94th position in the Global Cybersecurity Index 2020 from the 106th slot in the 2018 edition, showing that its commitment to cybersecurity has increased, according to the International Telecommunication Union.The Himalayan republic scored 44.99 out of 100 points among 182 countries. It was placed 17th among the 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, said the International Telecommunication Union.But Nepal still has a long way to go.The panellists at the Digital Nepal Conclave said that education, skill development, government impetus and branding Nepal were equally important to bring scalable business from abroad.“There is no shortage of finance to invest in the information and technology sector. The private sector is willing to invest, but the investment environment is not favourable,” said Sanjay Golchha, managing director of Neoteric Nepal, which provides information and technology solutions to companies and small and medium-sized enterprises. “There is a big trust issue. There is no investment in skill development in the information and technology sector, and Nepal is not being branded as a place for offshoring,"" Golchha said. Last week, the World Bank approved $140 million in support for the Digital Nepal Acceleration Project to expand access to broadband and engage more people in the digital economy. According to the World Bank, the project will create better job opportunities for about 1,500 people by providing digital skills development training.The project will support the implementation of the Digital Nepal Framework, the country’s digital economy strategy released by the government in 2019. The project will improve access to high-quality and affordable broadband services, especially for people and businesses in rural areas.It will also support and secure the delivery of digital government services through improvements in Nepal’s data infrastructure and cyber security. Specific activities will seek to boost internet use, digital skills and entrepreneurship, and access to digital services by women, ethnic and social minorities, and persons with disabilities, the multilateral funding agency said.The Covid-19 pandemic had hit all types of foreign investment in 2020. According to the UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2021, the global FDI inflow in 2020 declined by 34.7 percent to $998.9 billion. The restrictive measures around the world in response to the Covid-19 pandemic led to a slowdown in project activity across Greenfield investments, project finance deals and cross-border mergers and acquisitions that resulted in significant decline of FDI inflows around the world. FDI in the developed economies decreased significantly by 58.3 percent in 2020 to $312.2 billion from $749 billion in 2019 whereas inflows to the developing economies decreased moderately by 8.4 percent to $662.6 billion from $723.4 billion in 2019.FDI inflows to South Asia increased by 20.9 percent to $69.7 billion in 2020. Net FDI inflows to Nepal increased by 49.1 percent to Rs19.48 billion in 2019-20, according to Nepal Rastra Bank. The recent trend of FDI realisation shows that there is a huge gap between approved FDI and actual net FDI inflows in Nepal. An FDI approval indicates an intended investment. The approved investment may not actually take place or there may be significant time lags between the approval and the actual investment, the central bank said. In some instances, the realisation of the approved investment may take place over several years, as is usually seen in projects with a long gestation period.“Hence, there is a gap between FDI approval and actual FDI inflows. Between 1995-96 and 2019-20, the total actual net FDI inflow in Nepal stood at around 34.1 percent of total FDI approval,” according to Nepal Rastra Bank.

582,"Tired of waiting, farmers start planting paddy without chemical fertilisers","Sunil Ali, a farmer from Khajani, Rupandehi, has started paddy transplantation a few weeks before the normal planting season—because there was abundant water. This year, the monsoon arrived eight days earlier, on June 5, than normal, bringing cheers to farmers.Nepal’s economic wellbeing is intimately linked with the monsoon. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs4.85 trillion economy which is farm-dependent, as nearly two thirds of the farmlands have no better source of irrigation.But Ali has no chemical fertiliser, a vital farm input.Fertiliser contains nutrients that plants need, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, to boost their growth.“I need 12 sacks [1 sack is 50 kg] of chemical fertiliser for my 5 bigha [3.35 hectares] of farmland,” Ali said. The state-subsidised fertiliser was not available.“I could not bring them from India,” he said. “So I transplanted paddy without applying them.”Usually, when a fertiliser crisis grips Nepal, farmers in the country’s southern belt hop across the border to smuggle in the plant nutrients. This year, borders are regulated and police have punished many farmers for smuggling in fertiliser. “I knew that my neighbours were fined and the fertiliser they brought from India was seized,” he said. “So I gave up the idea.”On Saturday, frantic farmers of Dharke in Dhading looted two trucks loaded with chemical fertiliser as they were being escorted to Kathmandu.Video clips circulating on social media showed farmers grabbing sacks of fertilisers and running away. The incident shows the urgency of the farm inputs in the key crop transplanting season and desperation of farmers.Security personnel failed to control the frenzied crowd of farmers. Around 400 of the 500 sacks the two trucks were ferrying vanished in less than half-an-hour.The Dharke incident is an example of how desperate farmers across the country are for fertilisers.Dhiraj Yadav of Khajani, Rupandehi has 7 bigha [4.69 hectares] of farmland.He is in immediate need of 20 sacks of fertiliser but has not gotten even a grain yet.Yadav was informed by cooperatives, which distribute the state-subsidised chemical fertiliser, that it would arrive in a week. He went to ask if it had arrived. “The answer was obvious,"" he said. “Next week.”Yadav is not convinced though. But he can barely do anything. “There is no certainty when the fertiliser will come. We can't miss the good time to transplant the paddy. I did it without chemical fertiliser,” he said.Yadav is encouraged by the abundant rainfall but worried about poor harvest. Over the coming months, a major challenge for farmers will be accessing fertiliser, which may impact food production across many crops in different regions, according to the World Bank’s May report on food security.Agro experts say urea needs to be applied during the transplantation and then first top dressing—two to three weeks after transplantation.Paddy saplings have grown green in the nursery of Ashok Kurmi in Palhinandan of West Nawalparasi.Despite not having an irrigation system, he is not much concerned, as he can use water pumps to irrigate his farm. His main worry is fertiliser.The Agricultural Inputs Company, the government’s supply body, does not have enough fertiliser, he said.“If I fail to transplant the seedlings within the next few days, they will turn yellow,” Kurmi told the Post.Many farmers in India are paying huge amounts, four to five times the normal rates, according to farmers. But it’s not easy to bring them to Nepal. Some farmers have applied the di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) by purchasing it from India at Rs2,500 per sack.Ramakanta Kafle of Sunwal 7 said that local representatives have been passing the buck to the federal government.""The local representatives had committed in their election manifestos to prioritising agriculture. They had made promises that there won’t be a shortage of fertiliser,” he said. “Now it has become clear that they all lied.”Kafle says local representatives cannot shirk their responsibilities.“We voted them to serve us. Now they are blaming the federal government,” Kafle said. “They need to distribute the fertiliser even by bringing it from India. We need it now.” Local representatives say they cannot manage the fertiliser immediately as it is the federal government’s responsibility to procure and distribute them.“We are not authorised to buy chemical fertilisers,” said Shambhu Lal Shrestha, mayor of Bardaghat Municipality in Nawalparasi. “We had demanded fertilisers from the federal government but it looks like it is not immediately available. We understand preparations to acquire fertiliser for summer crops needs to be done as early as the winter.”The warehouse of Bhairahawa branch of the Agricultural Inputs Company, which is responsible for distributing fertilisers in three provinces in western Nepal, is currently empty. The company distributes fertilisers in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudhurpaschim provinces as well as in Syangja and Nawalpur of the Gandaki Province.There is an acute shortage of farm nutrients in Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces at the peak paddy transplantation time. The Bhairahawa-based regional office of the Agriculture Inputs Company has received only 24,007 tonnes of urea and 16,074 tonnes of DAP since mid-July last year. Urea has yet to arrive since they ran out of it in mid-January, according to company officials.At present, the company has about 1,338 tonnes of DAP in stock. The rest has been distributed. “We have few quantities of potash and DAP in stock. This stock has been allotted for the crop pocket areas of the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project,"" said Narayan Prasad Sharma, chief of the Agricultural Input Company regional office in Bhairahawa. “We are not sure when the fertiliser will come.”Various humanitarian agencies have warned that higher fertiliser prices and a global shortage of supply due to the Russia-Ukraine war may impact food prices and production for low income countries like Nepal.Nepal’s bid to procure fertiliser from India under a government-to-government agreement has yet to yield results. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister Mahendra Raya Yadav was in New Delhi to follow up on fertiliser procurement from India.India itself is one of the worst affected by the worldwide fertiliser crisis. India imports up to a third of its fertiliser and is the world’s biggest buyer of urea and di-ammonium phosphate.To fast-track the supply, Nepal also cleared legal hurdles. But farmers are still waiting to get the farm nutrients.Last week, the Parliament told the government to ensure chemical fertiliser by any means necessary even as countries around the globe are scrambling to avert a seemingly inevitable drop in crop yields due to a worldwide shortage of nutrients.“This is not the first time that there has been a shortage of fertiliser during the transplantion season,” said Ali, the farmer from Khajani. “This is a recurring problem every year. It’s us farmers who have been bearing the brunt of the state’s failure.”  ",Nepal’s economic wellbeing is intimately linked with the monsoon .Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs4.85 trillion economy which is farm-dependent .Nearly two thirds of the farmlands have no better source of irrigation .,https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-5/2022/06/20/tired-of-waiting-farmers-start-planting-paddy-without-chemical-fertilisers,Kathmandu Post,Lumbini Province ,6/20/2022 7:43
581,Cholera outbreak feared in Kathmandu,"On Sunday, the Ministry of Health and Population confirmed cholera infection in two people in Kathmandu. The disease was detected in two sisters aged 18 and 23 years from Kathmandu Metropolitan City-28, Bagbazar.“Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of the patients,” said Dr Manisha Rawal, director at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, where the patients have been receiving care.Sporadic cases of suspected cholera have been reported in the Valley of late, according to officials at the infectious disease hospital.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The two sisters were admitted to the hospital on Thursday afternoon. The patients were reportedly suffering from frequent bowel movements, as many as 30 in a day, before being taken to the hospital. The Kathmandu Model Hospital, where they were taken first, had carried out antigen tests of their stool samples that returned positive for cholera.Doctors at the hospital referred the patients to Sukraraj Hospital as their conditions were critical.According to Rawal, the patients were unconscious when they were brought to the hospital, where they were admitted to the intensive care unit. “It took more than 24 hours for their health to stabilise,” Rawal said. “They are out of danger now.”Stool samples of the infected patients were sent to the National Public Health Laboratory for further confirmation. The lab confirmed the infection of the deadly disease in both samples.The Sukraraj Hospital said that three other individuals—a 50-year-old from Sanepa in Lalitpur, a 65-year-old from Kuleshwor in Kathmandu and a 28-year-old from Sindhupalchok who works in Kathmandu—have been admitted at the hospital’s intensive care unit with severe diarrhoea, which is one of the symptoms of cholera. The patients’ stool samples, too, have been sent to the National Public Health Laboratory for testing.Doctors warn that increase in rainfall and disruption in garbage collection in Kathmandu Valley have increased the risk of contamination in drinking water sources and, therefore, of outbreak of waterborne diseases like cholera.In October last year, Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The UN health agency says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.

580,Nepal government decides not to move ahead with US government’s State Partnership Program,"The government has decided not to move ahead with the US government’s State Partnership Program.A Cabinet meeting on Monday took a decision to this effect.“Today’s Cabinet meeting has made three decisions—not to move ahead on the SPP, inform the US government and make all correspondence only through the Foreign Ministry,” said Rajendra Shrestha, minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration. “The point is that direct correspondence by the army has not done good to the country. All correspondence should have been made through the Foreign Ministry.”Nepal’s “participation” in the SPP has become a hotly debated political issue, with political parties engaged in a blame-game. According to the US, Washington accepted Nepal in the SPP in 2019 after it applied twice in 2015 and 2017.Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was under pressure from the main opposition CPN-UML as well as his own party, the Nepali Congress, to terminate Nepal’s partnership in the SPP.After controversy erupted over Nepal and its partnership in the SPP, the US embassy in Kathmandu last week said that Nepal can stop its participation in the SPP if it wishes so.“When Nepal asked to participate in the program in 2015, and again in 2017, the request involved civilian, government, and military leaders from Nepal, openly looking to take advantage of a program focused on security cooperation and exchanges, and humanitarian assistance and disaster readiness,” said the embassy in the statement. “A country can simply inform the United States that they no longer wish to participate in the programme.”Asked if the government has decided to send any letter to the US seeking to terminate its partnership in the SPP, government’s spokesperson Gyanendra Bahadur Karki said the Cabinet has just decided “not to move ahead with the SPP,” without further elaborating.

579,US swimmer Alvarez saved from drowning by coach,"American artistic swimmer Anita Alvarez was in danger of drowning after losing consciousness in the pool at the world championships in Budapest on Wednesday before being rescued by her coach Andrea Fuentes.Spaniard Fuentes, a four-time Olympic medallist in synchronised swimming, jumped into the pool after she saw Alvarez sink to the bottom at the end of her solo free final routine.She was given medical attention beside the pool before being taken away on a stretcher.It was the second time Fuentes has had to rescue Alvarez after she leapt into the pool during an Olympic qualification event last year and pulled her to safety along with the American’s swim partner Lindi Schroeder.“Anita is much better, she is already at her best. It was a good scare, to be honest,” Fuentes told Spanish newspaper Marca on Wednesday.“I jumped into the water again because I saw that no one, no lifeguard, was jumping in. I got a little scared because she wasn’t breathing, but now she's fine. She has to rest.”In a statement on the US Artistic Swimming Instagram page, Fuentes said 25-year-old Alvarez would be assessed by doctors on Thursday before a decision was made on her participation in Friday’s team event.

578,Beijing says it commends Nepal’s decision not to move ahead with America’s SPP,"China says it welcomes the Nepal government’s decision of not moving ahead with the State Partnership Program of the United States government. Speaking at a regular press briefing, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China’s Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that as a friendly and close neighbour and strategic cooperative partner, China commends the Nepali government’s decision [not to move ahead with the SPP.]The statement from the Chinese government comes three days after the Sher Bahadur Deuba Cabinet on Monday decided not to move ahead with the SPP.“Various political parties and factions, the government, the army and people across the Nepalese society see the SPP as a military and security initiative closely linked to the Indo-Pacific Strategy,” said Wang, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry’s statement, “and they consider it against the national interests of Nepal and its long-held non-aligned, balanced foreign policy to be part of the SPP.”The SPP has become a hotly debated political issue in Nepal with parties engaging in a blame-game.According to the US embassy in Kathmandu, Washington accepted Nepal in the SPP in 2019 after two requests—first in 2015 and then in 2017.As per a letter dated October 27, 2015, the then Nepal Army chief Rajendra Chhetri had requested Nepal’s association with the SPP. The Cabinet on Monday took the decision not to move ahead with the SPP following widespread criticism and pressure from various quarters, including the main opposition CPN-UML, a House committee, coalition partner as well as Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba’s own party, Nepali Congress.Beijing had earlier in February spoken about Washington’s “coercive diplomacy” when a debate was raging over ratification of the Millenium Challenge Corporation. The Chinese see both the MCC and SPP as an American strategy to expand Washington's influence and counter China. Despite China’s concerns, Nepal’s Parliament, however, had ratified the MCC on February 27.On Thursday, Wang said China will continue to support Nepal in upholding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and support Nepal’s commitment to its independent and non-aligned foreign policy. “China stands ready to work with Nepal to jointly safeguard regional security, stability and shared prosperity,” he said.  ",China says it welcomes the Nepal government’s decision of not moving ahead with the State Partnership Program of the United States government .The statement from the Chinese government comes three days after the Sher Bahadur Deuba Cabinet on Monday decided not to move ahead with the SPP .The Chinese see both the MCC and SPP as an American strategy to expand Washington's influence and counter China .,https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/23/beijing-says-it-commends-nepal-s-decision-not-to-move-ahead-with-america-s-spp,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/23/2022 18:39

576,EU grants Ukraine candidate status in ‘historic moment’,"Ukraine became a candidate to join the European Union on Thursday, a bold geopolitical step triggered by Russia’s invasion that Kyiv and Brussels hailed as an “historic moment”.Starting on the long path to EU membership will be a huge boost to morale in the embattled country, as Russian assaults on two cities in the eastern Donbas region move toward a “fearsome climax”, according to a Ukrainian government adviser.“Ukraine’s future is in the EU,” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter after the official announcement.“A historic moment,” European Council chief Charles Michel tweeted, adding: “Our future is together.”The approval of the Kyiv government’s application by EU leaders meeting in Brussels will anger Russia as it struggles to impose its will on Ukraine. Moldova also became an official candidate on Thursday, signalling the bloc’s intention to reach deep into the former Soviet Union.Friday will mark four months since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops across the border in what he calls a “special military operation” sparked in part by Western encroachment into what Russia considers its sphere of influence.The conflict, which the West sees as an unjustified war of aggression by Russia, has killed thousands, displaced millions, and destroyed cities, while the curtailment of food and energy exports has affected countries across the world.Russia has focused its campaign on southern and eastern Ukraine after its advance on the capital in the early stages of the conflict was thwarted by Ukrainian resistance.The war of attrition in the Donbas - Ukraine’s industrial heartland - is most critical in the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, which sit on opposite banks of the Siverskyi Donets River in Luhansk province.The battle there is “entering a sort of fearsome climax”, said Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy.Hot summerRussian forces were trying to encircle Ukrainian troops defending Lysychansk, senior Ukrainian defence official Oleksiy Gromov said in a briefing on Thursday.Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai said separately that all Lysychansk was within reach of Russian fire and that Ukrainian troops there might retreat to new positions to avoid being trapped.Russian-backed separatist forces said there was fierce fighting underway around Ukrainian positions in Hirske, which lies on the western side of the main north-south road to Lysychansk, and Zolote, another settlement to the south.Ukrainian forces were defending Sievierodonetsk and nearby Zolote and Vovchoyrovka, Gaidai said, but Russian troops had captured Loskutivka and Rai-Oleksandrivka to the south. Hundreds of civilians are trapped in a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk.On the southern front, Russian forces struck Ukrainian army fuel tanks and military equipment near Mykolaiv with high-precision weapons, Russia’s defence ministry said, quoted by the Interfax news agency.A river port and ship-building centre just off the Black Sea, Mykolaiv has been a bastion against Russian efforts to push West towards Ukraine’s main port city of Odesa.Zelenskiy urged Ukraine’s allies to speed up shipments of heavy weapons to match Russia on the battlefield. “We must free our land and achieve victory, but more quickly, a lot more quickly,” he said in a video address early on Thursday.Later, Ukrainian defence minister said HIMARS multiple rocket systems had arrived from the United States. With a range of 70 km (44 miles), the systems can challenge the Russian artillery batteries that have bludgeoned Ukrainian cities from afar.The United States will provide an additional $450 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including more long-range rocket systems, U.S. officials said on Thursday.Shield for the EURussia has long opposed closer links between Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic, and Western groupings like the European Union and the NATO military alliance.Diplomats say it will take Ukraine a decade or more to meet the criteria for joining the EU.But European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was convinced that Ukraine and Moldova will move as swiftly as possible to implement necessary reforms.Their move to join the EU runs alongside applications by Sweden and Finland to enter NATO in the wake of the Russian invasion - indications that the Kremlin’s military actions have backfired on its geopolitical aims.In Kyiv, where mass protests eight years ago ousted the then-president after he broke a promise to develop closer ties with the EU, 22-year-old serviceman Volodymyr Yanishan welcomed Ukraine’s candidate status.“It means that people almost reached what we have been striving for since 2014, in a bloody fight which cost us much effort... I think the majority will be glad and it means changes for better.” ","Moldova also became an official candidate on Thursday, signalling the bloc’s intention to reach deep into the former Soviet Union .The approval of the Kyiv government’s application by EU leaders meeting in Brussels will anger Russia as it struggles to impose its will on Ukraine .The conflict, which the West sees as an unjustified war of aggression by Russia, has killed thousands, displaced millions, and destroyed cities .",https://kathmandupost.com/world/2022/06/24/eu-grants-ukraine-candidate-status-in-historic-moment,Kathmandu Post,World ,6/24/2022 10:49
575,Government is in a fix. It has decided to shun SPP but is not clear how to do that,"In a reactive move, the government on Monday decided not to move ahead on the United States government’s State Partnership Program, following pressure from various quarters.It, however, is in a fix. How to do that?The Foreign Ministry said that it received the Cabinet decision on Thursday, but has yet to decide on its action. “We received a communication from the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers regarding the decision on the SPP taken by the Cabinet just today [Thursday],” said a Foreign Ministry official. “We are coordinating with the political leadership and discussing the decision as it does not categorically say anything.”The official said the ministry understands the gravity of the matter and that it will act as per the instructions of the political leadership.While deciding not to move ahead on the SPP, the Cabinet on Monday also decided that all communications to foreign governments should be made through the Foreign Ministry. Now it’s up to the ministry to communicate to the US government as per the Cabinet decision, which officials find vague. The delay in writing to the US despite the Cabinet decision has given rise to speculations if the Americans in Kathmandu have conveyed, through unofficial channels, their displeasure to the top leadership.The SPP has become a hot potato in Nepal, with almost all political parties arguing against Nepal’s participation in it. A debate on the SPP took centre stage after some sections of the media circulated a document which was dubbed a draft agreement between the Nepal Army and Utah National Guard of the United States.The US embassy was quick to react, calling the document “fake”. It, however, said that the US accepted Nepal in the SPP in 2019 after its two requests in 2015 and 21017. But the Nepal Army put out a statement on June 15, clarifying it has not and will not participate in the SPP. A day later, the Army had to scramble for justification, as a letter dated October 27, 2015, undersigned by then Army chief Rajendra Chhetri, made it to the public domain. In the letter written to the then US ambassador Alaina B Teplitz, the Nepal Army has requested its association in the SPP. The Army confirmed the authenticity of the letter but said it was about seeking support for the relief and rescue efforts after the earthquakes. At a House committee meeting last week, Foreign Minister Naryan Khadka and Army Chief Prabhu Ram Sharma said that Nepal is not part of the SPP and it does not intend to be. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was summoned for Sunday, skipped the House committee meeting, citing his busy schedule.As the main opposition CPN-UML was lashing out at the Deuba government over the SPP, Congress general secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma too urged the prime minister not to join the partnership as it could have security and military consequences. Amid confusion whether Nepal indeed is part of the SPP or not, it was the US embassy in Kathmandu that came up with a statement in which it said a country can terminate its association with the SPP by writing a letter.The government then said Nepal won’t move ahead on the SPP but stopped short of explicitly saying how to end its association, if any. Foreign Ministry officials say they would act on the decision only after further consultations with the government and the political leadership.On Tuesday, a day after the Cabinet decision on the SPP, Anna Richey-Allen, a spokesperson for the US embassy in Kathmandu, told the Post whether to participate in the State Partnership Program or not is Nepal’s decision.“Worldwide, the State Partnership Program brings together the US National Guard and military/civilian personnel for a variety of training and education both in the United States and in the partner nation,” she said. “Of the nearly 90 countries with the State Partnership Program, only Belarus has ended its participation.”In the last 75 years of bilateral ties, the US has provided several kinds of assistance to Nepal, including military aid. The SPP, however, stoked concerns as the issue surfaced on the heels of Nepal’s ratification of the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact amid opposition from some quarters who called it part of the Washington-led Indo-Pacific Strategy. The US has put the SPP as well under the IPS.Critics of the MCC compact said that its ratification would pave the way for Americans to have boots on the ground in Nepal. Since the SPP is also about military-to-military exchange, political and intellectual circles expressed concerns if the United States army personnel would set up barracks in Nepal. The US embassy, however, has ruled out any such initiatives.“Independent of the SPP, the US bilateral relationship that has focused on people-to-people connections including student and professional exchanges, diplomatic engagement, military partnership, trade, and common values remains strong,” said the US spokesperson.There are also concerns if the row over the SPP could affect Deuba’s planned visit to the US. Deuba is set to visit the US in mid-July, but no official announcement has been made yet. Chief of the Army Staff General Prabhu Ram Sharma who has already embarked on a foreign trip will reach Washington on June 27.The embassy said that Nepal’s decision [on the SPP] won’t affect any bilateral exchanges. “Visits by Nepali officials to the United States and vice versa will continue to be an important part of our relationship,” she said.Meanwhile, Beijing has said that it welcomes the Nepal government’s decision of not moving ahead with the SPP. Speaking at a regular press briefing, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China’s Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday that as a friendly and close neighbour and strategic cooperative partner, China commends the Nepali government’s decision [not to move ahead on the SPP.]“Various political parties and factions, the government, the army and people across the Nepalese society see the SPP as a military and security initiative closely linked to the Indo-Pacific Strategy,” said Wang, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry’s statement, “and they consider it against the national interests of Nepal and its long-held non-aligned, balanced foreign policy to be part of the SPP.”Beijing had earlier in February spoken about Washington’s “coercive diplomacy” when a debate was raging over ratification of the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact.

574,Madhav Nepal’s tale of woe continues with ministers defying party decision,"For Madhav Kumar Nepal, remaining in the ruling coalition has not been easy. He is clearly not happy with the poll results and he believes the major coalition partners—Nepali Congress and CPN (Maoist Centre)—were not supportive during local elections. But his problem is he cannot walk away from the coalition.His tale of woe doesn’t end here. He is struggling to keep his party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) which was born just nine months ago in August, in order. Despite the party’s Standing Committee meeting deciding earlier this month to recall the current set of ministers and send a new line-up, the decision is yet to be implemented. Amid this, the four ministers from the party have threatened Nepal and put forth conditions for them to be recalled.As the party faces the threat of an implosion, some leaders have blamed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for being reluctant to implement its Standing Committee decision. “Most of the leaders in the meeting today said the prime minister delayed the implementation of our party’s decision,” said a Secretariat member asking not to be named. “So the party chair will have to press him for Cabinet reshuffle at the earliest.” The Cabinet reshuffle issue has been in discussions ever since the results of the local polls were out. Then it was stalled for the budget presentation and its passage. Insiders say now the prime minister is waiting for the National Assembly to pass the budget for reshuffling the Cabinet. An aide to the prime minister said that Cabinet reshuffle is likely only after the Unified Socalist officially hands over the names of the leaders to be appointed as ministers. “Reshuffle could also happen on Friday but I don’t think the Unified Socialist has presented its official decision at the prime minister’s secretariat yet,” he said, asking not to be named. But Cabinet reshuffle is easier said than done for Deuba. He does not want to run the risk of setting a chain of events in motion. Once he changes Unified Socialist ministers, he will face pressure from other parties as well, including his own Nepali Congress to do the same. A leader close to Deuba said there are aspirants in other parties as well. But there is yet another reason Deuba will wait for a while before he changes Unified Socialist ministers. “Not just Deuba, Maoist Centre Pushpa Kamal Dahal also is against the reshuffle at this point of time,” said a Congress leader. “Changing the current set of ministers from the Unified Socialist may stoke trouble in the party, which can have an impact on the coalition.”Both Deuba and Dahal want the current coalition to remain strong until the upcoming polls. Nepal has not been able to tame his ministers also because he wants to save his party. Insiders say Nepal failed to react to the high-handed attitude of his party’s ministers, especially Prem Ale and Ram Kumari Jhakri, because he fears they could desert him, which could throw the nascent party into disarray. And Deuba and Dahal have to pay attention to the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) as well, said the Congress leader. JSP is also facing the risk of a vertical split with its federal council chair Baburam Bhattarai upping the ante against chair Upendra Yadav. Bhattarai has already conveyed to Deuba not to accept Yadav’s “unilateral” decision to change the ministers. The Unified Socialist has four ministers and a minister of state in the government while JSP also has four ministers.“Cabinet reshuffle at this time will have multiple ramifications for the coalition,” said the Congress leader. “So Deuba and Dahal are treading carefully.”Meanwhile, some Unified Socialist leaders say they will take up the issue at the politburo and the Central Committee. “Our decision to change the ministers has not been implemented yet. We will raise this issue at higher committees. If party decisions are not implemented, it will send a negative message to our members,” said Gangalal Tuladhar, deputy general secretary of the Unified Socialist. “We have agreed that chair Nepal will have to press the prime minister to implement the party's decision at the earliest.”According to Tuladhar, party leaders have seriously raised the issue at their secretariat meeting saying that the prime minister has blocked their decision on one pretext or the other. According to leaders participating in Thursday’s secretariat meeting, questions were raised if the party should continue to remain in the coalition. But the party has decided not to walk out of the coalition until the upcoming federal and provincial polls, they said. Party chair Nepal’s calls that the four ministers pave the way for other leaders have been brazenly turned down. Party spokesman Jagannath Khatiwada, however, ruled out any possibility of a revolt.“There are talks that the ministers could even defect to other parties if they are asked to quit, but that’s just speculation,” spokesman Khatiwada told the Post. Birodh Khatiwada, who is health minister from the Unified Socialist, said after the budget is endorsed by the Federal Parliament, the prime minister will reshuffle the Cabinet in consultation with leaders of the coalition. “It’s not a new thing for party leaders to meet our chairman,” said Minister Khatiwada. “We have asked the chairman to change the ministers after the budget is passed and ensure balance of region, ethnicity, and gender as well.”Jeevan Ram Shrestha, a Standing Committee member, who was named as the replacement for Ale, the tourism minister, said he has been told by some party leaders that information about the oath will come by Friday. “But I have not received any information officially as of now,” Shrestha told the Post on Thursday evening. “Let’s see.” ",The four ministers from the party have threatened Nepal and put forth conditions for them to be recalled .Some leaders have blamed Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba for being reluctant to implement its Standing Committee decision .The Cabinet reshuffle issue has been in discussions ever since the results of the local polls were out .,https://kathmandupost.com/politics/2022/06/24/madhav-nepal-s-tale-of-woe-continues-with-ministers-defying-party-decision,Kathmandu Post,Politics ,6/24/2022 7:42
573,US vows more high-level engagement with Pacific islands amid China push,"White House Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell said on Thursday he expects more high-level US officials to visit Pacific island countries as Washington steps up its engagement to counter China in the strategically important region.Campbell said the United States needed more diplomatic facilities across the region, and more contact with Pacific island countries that at times “receive lesser attention.”“You will see more cabinet-level, more senior officials, going to the Pacific ... recognizing that nothing replaces, really, diplomatic boots on the ground,” he told Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies.The Biden administration has vowed to commit more resources to the Indo-Pacific as China seeks to boost economic, military and police links with Pacific island nations hungry for foreign investment.Beijing’s growing influence was highlighted by its security pact with the Solomon Islands this year, a move that fanned concerns in Australia, New Zealand and the United States.“Sovereignty is central in terms of how we see the Pacific overall. Any initiative that compromises or calls into question that sovereignty, I think we would have concerns with,” Campbell said, without referring to China.Washington has said it will expedite the opening of an embassy in the Solomon Islands, announced earlier this year when Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Fiji, the first trip there by America’s top diplomat in four decades.Campbell said he envisioned Fiji would be one of the United States’ “hubs” of engagement.“Our mantra will be nothing in the Pacific without the Pacific ... we do not take these bonds for granted,” he said, acknowledging perceptions that Washington had not always sufficiently taken the needs of islanders into account.Monica Medina, responsible for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs at the US State Department, said areas where Pacific islands particularly needed help included coping with climate change and countering illegal fishing.“We know we have much, much, much more work to do,” she said.Fiji’s UN ambassador, Satyendra Prasad, told the CSIS event the islands needed “great predictability” and no “stop-start” in ties with Washington.“Pacific people and their governments would welcome an enduring partnership with US that is there for the long-term,” he said.Samoa’s UN envoy said there was a need to see whether a US treaty with the Pacific covering tuna could be expanded into a wider trade agreement.“I think that is already under consideration,” Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Pa’olelei Luteru said. “That’s something that would be very helpful.”Washington could also help by supporting the UN-driven Multi-Dimensional Vulnerability Index to help island nations access concessional financing.In apparent reference to China’s attraction, Luteru said politicians had a responsibility to their people.“If ... you ask a particular country and they are not able to help you, you then have a choice to say no, we’re not going to provide that service to the people; or you go to another country that perhaps is not the traditional partner, and you say to them, can you help us?” he said.

572,"Afghanistan ends search for survivors of earthquake that killed 1,000","Authorities in Afghanistan have ended the search for survivors of an earthquake that killed 1,000 people, a senior official said on Friday, adding that supplies of medicine and other critical aid were inadequate.About 2,000 people were injured and 10,000 houses were partially or completely destroyed in Wednesday’s earthquake in a remote area near the border with Pakistan, Mohammad Nassim Haqqani, a spokesperson for the disaster ministry, told Reuters.“The search operation has finished, 1,000 are dead and the injured are around 2,000, both serious and superficial injuries,” Haqqani said.He did not elaborate on why the search for survivors was being called off after some 48 hours. Survivors have been pulled from the rubble of other earthquakes after considerably more time.The 6.1 magnitude earthquake struck about 160 km (100 miles) southeast of Kabul, in a region of arid mountains dotted with small settlements that has often been at the centre of Afghanistan’s decades of war.Poor communications and a lack of proper roads have hampered relief efforts in a country already grappling with a humanitarian crisis that has deteriorated since the Taliban took over last August.Haqqani said Afghanistan did not have enough critical supplies to treat the wounded.“The health ministry does not have enough drugs, we need medical aid and other necessities because it’s a big disaster,” he said.The rescue operation will be a major test for the hardline Islamist Taliban, who took over as U.S.-led international forces withdrew after 20 years of war.The country has since been largely isolated, cut off from much direct international assistance because of sanctions.Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates all said on Thursday they plan to send aid. Supplies from neighbour Pakistan have already crossed the border.India, which has a strained relationship with the Taliban, said it had sent 27 tonnes of supplies on two flights to be handed over to international aid agencies.Large parts of South Asia are seismically active because a tectonic plate known as the Indian plate is pushing north into the Eurasian plate.In 2015, an earthquake struck the remote Afghan northeast, killing several hundred people in Afghanistan and nearby northern Pakistan.

567,SDGs: Failing to have impacts,"In September 2015, leaders from 193 countries gathered in the UN assembly hall in New York to plan nothing less than “transforming our world”. This was the birth of the sustainable development goals, which aimed to “free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet”.There are 17 sustainable development goals, or SDGs, encompassing 169 more detailed targets and over 200 measures of progress. There is almost nothing that the UN does not seek to improve with these goals, from reducing poverty and hunger to securing better health, education, gender equality, sanitation, energy, economic growth and infrastructure, while reducing social inequality, ensuring sustainable consumption, protecting the climate, ocean, biodiversity and forests, and furthering peace and justice.To give just a few examples of the 169 targets under these overarching goals, governments agreed, by 2030, to halve the proportion of people in poverty, end hunger, ensure all children complete a quality education for free, raise the income of the poorest 40 percent of each country’s population at a rate above the national average, and significantly increase funding to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems. The list goes on.Sustainable development goals are found wherever UN bureaucrats and international diplomats meet. You’ll see the 17 flags of the SDGs in the lush gardens of the UN headquarters in New York. Posters listing the SDGs hang in government offices all around the world. Dozens of international meetings are held to discuss them each year. The UN even announced an international decade of action for achieving the goals. In the Netherlands, where I live, the government has appointed an SDG coordinator whom I once spotted in an electric car painted with the SDG symbols and a suit with the SDGs printed on the inner lining. In short, if you turn over a stone, you may find an SDG.And yet, it is fair to ask: Do these global goals actually change anything? Do they tangibly influence the actions of governments, business leaders, mayors, UN bureaucrats and university presidents? For the last few years, a growing community of social scientists has considered this question. With 61 colleagues from around the world, we analysed more than 3,000 academic studies that scrutinised aspects of the SDGs. Our findings are published in the journal Nature Sustainability, and a more detailed assessment will soon be published as a book. Because we believe it is important to share what we found with everyone, both publications will be free to download and read.All talk, no actionUnfortunately, our findings are disheartening. The SDGs have infiltrated the things people say, think and write about global sustainability challenges. Governments mention the SDGs in their national reports to the UN, and some have set up coordinating units to implement them. Multinational corporations like to refer to the SDGs as well—especially those goals that are least disruptive to their commercial activities, like SDG 8 which calls on governments to “sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances”. And unsurprisingly, UN organisations are all formally supportive of the SDGs.But nothing has changed where it matters. We found few new policies, institutions or budget allocations designed to further specific goals. Did any government change its laws to achieve the many intersecting transformations envisioned by the SDGs? Did any ministry in those governments create new programmes for implementing the SDGs? If so, there is little evidence of it. What we found instead are changes in discourse. Those in power now refer to the SDGs often. Yet the way they govern has not changed.What should we make of this? Optimists point to the SDG timeline: The SDGs were only agreed upon in 2015 and are to be achieved by 2030. The analysis that we published largely uses research from before 2021. In other words, we have eight more years to go. That governments and corporations talk differently about sustainability and refer to the SDGs more often today can be seen as a sign of hope that this talk will be followed by action.And yet, mere talk can backfire by conferring legitimacy on unsustainable behaviour, letting corporate leaders wave colourful SDG flags while prizing profits above all else. Simply talking about SDGs can demobilise civil society by creating a false impression of action. Even as promised, transformations remain elusive. Idle talk acts as a smokescreen, hiding the reality of delay and stagnation.I do not want to belittle the importance of having the SDGs. Our study only provides a snapshot of the present state of implementing them. The SDGs do reflect some wonderfully high-minded global ambitions, not least by focusing on global inequalities (SDG 10), necessary improvements to national and global institutions (SDG 16) and the reduction of harmful consumption patterns in wealthy countries (SDG 12).But we have to make the goals actually work. Civil society and social movements need to prick the bubble of SDG talk. Government leaders and industry bosses must not be allowed to hide behind SDG flags in their offices, SDG buttons on their lapels and SDG logos on their glossy pamphlets. The SDGs cannot remain a lofty inspiration. We must convert their promise to action.—The ConversationRead the original article here.

566,A Nepali rebel in Tibet,"One of the most colourful of characters in Nepali politics was Kunwar Inderjit Singh, otherwise known as Dr KI Singh (1905-82). The ""Robin Hood of the Himalayas"" had fought for Indian revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army, practised homoeopathy (hence the title ""doctor""), led an armed assault on Rana forces in Bhairahawa during the 1950 revolution, redistributed land to peasants; and when dissatisfied with the 1950 agreement, raised his banners against the government. Singh was arrested in 1951 and imprisoned in Kathmandu. In January 1952, he broke out of prison and attempted a coup, failing which he and 37 of his followers left for Tibet.In 1955, after China and Nepal established diplomatic relations, Singh was pardoned by King Mahendra and returned to Nepal. Two years later, in July 1957, he was appointed prime minister, a tenure that was to last four months. His subsequent political career was a flip-flop between supporting the Panchayat regime or the multi-party system. Little is known of Singh’s life in Tibet, except that he had supposedly asked China to help him overthrow his government. Archival documents, however, reveal Nepal’s persistent efforts to extradite him, which were resisted on grounds of Chinese policies. Singh had certainly tried to make himself useful to Chinese authorities, but the latter weren’t too impressed, and in fact, were unsure about what to do with someone who had attempted a coup against a government they had no formal ties with at the time. Singh in TibetKI Singh arrived in Tibet in January 1952, crossing over from Rasuwagadhi. The Nepali representative in Lhasa prepared an assessment for Kathmandu, which was passed on to friendly governments such as India and the United States since the Nepal government wished such governments to be ""apprised of developments in Lhasa"". These reports, prepared by the US Embassy in Delhi for the State Department and other missions, indicated a convergence between the interests of the other powers and Nepal at a time when the Chinese People’s Liberation Army had recently entered Tibet. In April 1952, the Nepali representative was asked by four members of the Kashag, or the Tibetan governing council, whether Singh’s extradition request had come from Kathmandu or from the representative himself. ""Subba Youdha Gambhir told them he had made the request…on receipt of instructions to that effect from the Government of Nepal."" The Kashag members told him they would consult on the decision and revert, although he was told informally Tibet would assist Nepal according to the terms of the 1856 treaty between the two states. The Indian representative, Sumul Sinha, also thought the same, and hoped China too would not object to Singh’s extradition. Meanwhile, reports from Shigatse suggested Singh had been drawing maps of Nepal showing the various passes ""leading from Nepal into Tibet"". In Sekar Dzong, a dispute arose between Singh’s party and a Tibetan over a rifle sold by one of his followers. Both parties were to be punished by flogging, and Singh appealed to the authorities to punish another follower of his for ""not carrying out his orders on the way"". Reports also suggested ""the Chinese are not allowing Dr KI Singh to move about freely"", and that Singh and his party were being made to wear ""the same kind of dress as the Chinese themselves wear"". Singh had also requested the Chinese to send him to Beijing to discuss various matters with Mao which ""he could not disclose to so many different grades of Chinese officers"". He’d also told them ""officers from many countries including Americans now in Nepal are busy completing preparations to fight with China, and that the Chinese also should not remain inactive any longer but should be prepared for any eventuality"". A June 1952 report from the Indian mission confirmed Singh had ""emphasised the urgency of liberating Nepal"". Singh was escorted to Lhasa by Chinese authorities on May 26, 1952, and was put up at the home of the noted Pangdatsang family. ""The Chinese do not allow these Nepalese to move freely, and have appointed a strong guard over them."" Singh and his retinue were warned on ""pain of punishment"" not to speak with anyone, and were only provided rations and clothes. The Nepali representative immediately went to the Kashag to emphasise on Singh’s extradition, which was once again deferred. In June 1952, the representative was told that since Singh had sought asylum in Tibet, he could not be extradited according to Chinese laws, but Chinese authorities in Tibet had enquired with Beijing about Nepal’s demands. By August, the Nepali mission was running out of patience. ""It seemed to our Representative that KI Singh’s case was being kept secret, for the Kazis did not wish to meet and talk about this matter."" There were widespread rumours that Singh had already been taken to Beijing (he was first taken to Chengdu, and was taken to the Chinese capital only in May 1953). By September, the Nepalis were told in no uncertain terms by the Tibetans that the Chinese would not go against their policy of non-extradition. Return to NepalBecause China and Nepal were yet to establish diplomatic relations, and the Nepalis were communicating directly with the Tibetans about Singh’s extradition, China too seemed to be at a loss as to what to do with him. However, the Chinese did not regard him as a revolutionary, but more as a political fugitive. ""The Chinese rarely, if ever, publicised his arrival or used him in politically motivated ways… There also does not seem to be any evidence that they contemplated at any point benefiting from his presence in fomenting Communist activity in Nepal."" Going by reports about his confinement in Lhasa and thereafter, one can assume Singh’s presence was discomfiting to the Chinese too. Zhou Enlai told him after the 1954 India-China agreement that Beijing ""would never send even one soldier"" to Nepal, and once the 1955 Nepal-China agreement was concluded, Singh was no longer useful.By the end of August, Singh and his followers arrived at Rasuwagadhi, awaiting the royal pardon. A few days later, ""[w]ith a band playing, Singh proceeded through the streets of Kathmandu in September, half the population having turned out to see him"". At a public gathering, Singh praised India to the surprise of many, not least Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who later called him ""not a Communist–just a freebooter"". Despite such a colourful life, one cannot yet say with conviction whether Singh was a revolutionary or an opportunist. What is certain is that Singh was perhaps one of the earliest Nepali politicians whose positions shifted wherever the winds took him. Many today would be inspired by his antics.  ","Singh was arrested in 1951 and imprisoned in Kathmandu.In January 1952, he broke out of prison and attempted a coup, failing which he and 37 of his followers left for Tibet .Little is known of Singh’s life in Tibet, except that he had supposedly asked China to help him overthrow his government .",https://kathmandupost.com/columns/2022/06/23/a-nepali-rebel-in-tibet,Kathmandu Post,Columns ,6/24/2022 7:33
565,"In the dock, again","Just when we start to think that the judiciary cannot sink any lower, it surprises us by going lower. A leaked audio call purportedly between lawyer Rudra Pokhrel and Kathmandu District Court Judge Raj Kumar Koirala, negotiating a deal to have businessman Ichchha Raj Tamang, who is accused of bank fraud, released from jail, has been doing the rounds. A three-member judicial council has been formed with a 45-day deadline to investigate the matter; and if the allegations turn out to be indeed true, it exposes how justice has become a commodity that can be purchased through closed-door dealings. If proven to be true, the case exemplifies how the justices themselves are undermining the idea of justice by making corruption the mainstay of their profession; it proves how the last citadel of justice is hollowed out by the very people who lead it. But this is not the first time—nor will it be the last time—when a high-level judge has come under the radar for being potentially corrupt. The impeachment motion against Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana is pending in Parliament. Rana has remained under suspension for the past four months after 98 lawmakers representing the ruling coalition registered a motion against him in Parliament. He has been accused, among other things, of financial corruption, failure to maintain impartiality, and bench shopping. Ironically, it was a constitutional bench led by Rana himself that ousted KP Sharma Oli for undermining democracy in July last year. As the impeachment motion against the head of the judiciary remains in limbo, and as the idea of reforming the judiciary remains to be translated into action, the judiciary itself is in a suspended state. The travesty of justice being orchestrated in the courts is the result of years—and decades—of neglect when it comes to bringing corrupt members of the judiciary to book despite the corruption within the institution remaining an open secret. The corruptibility of the judiciary, though, is hardly an independent problem of the judiciary itself. Every other public institution of the country reeks of corruption, dereliction of duty and neglect for ethics and values. And this does not bode well for a fragile democracy like Nepal. The moment the impartiality of the judiciary is compromised, corrupt forces in every sector, especially politics, raise their heads. The way the judiciary is being embroiled in one controversy after another, it is increasingly showing symptoms of being in a crisis.If the crisis continues, it won’t be long before citizens completely lose faith in the judiciary. Before that happens, the judiciary calls for significant internal reforms. That begins right with the appointment of justices based on the vested interests of political parties rather than competence. More importantly, it is incumbent upon the justices themselves to remain true to the ideals of impartiality and incorruptibility. Those leading the country’s courts should rid themselves of the misconception that the authority of the courts and the justices should remain unchallenged. At the same time, citizens must remain vigilant about the goings-on in the judiciary, for its degeneration into a corrupt institution ultimately undermines their quest for justice.

564,7 cholera cases in 5 days raise alarm,"With three more people infected with cholera in two days, the tally of the confirmed cases of the contagious bacterial disease in Kathmandu Valley since Sunday has reached seven.Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been detected in stool samples of seven individuals so far, officials at the Ministry of Health and Population confirmed.The deadly disease has been found in diarrhoeal patients from Bagbazar, Dillibazar, Balaju, Balkhu, Sanepa and Kapan areas, raising the risk that the deadly pathogens might have already spread in several other places of the Capital. The development so far, public health experts say, is alarming. It could be just the tip of the iceberg, they say.The situation is worrying, say experts, given that all seven infected individuals have diarrhoeal symptoms while generally only one in 10 people who get infected with cholera develop severe symptoms such as watery diarrhoea and vomiting.“The infection might have spread to many places of the Valley, as only around 10 percent of infected people get severely ill from the infection,” said Dr Prabhat Adhikari, an infectious disease expert. “About 80 to 90 percent of infected people might not be aware of the infection and could be unwittingly spreading it to others.”Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year. According to the Health Ministry’s data from the last fiscal year, for every 1,000 children under five years of age, 349 suffered from diarrhoeal diseases.Doctors say that the bacteria is present in the faeces of an infected person for up to 10 days.With the confirmation of the deadly pathogens in the patients, authorities deployed a team to survey the infections. Water samples from household taps and tube wells in Bagbazar were found contaminated with E.coli and Coliform—the microbes found in human faeces.“We have deployed a team to survey the areas where diarrhoeal patients have been infected with cholera,” Dr Chuman Lal Das, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, said, adding that the team will collect water samples to locate the source of infection.Experts say testing water samples after an outbreak is akin to digging a well for water after a fire breaks out. They say that such a tendency in the authorities goes on to prove that there were no takeaways from the Covid-19 pandemic, which killed thousands and infected hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country.“We have been warning of a cholera outbreak in Kathmandu Valley since May after the garbage started to pile up in the streets,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, former director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Monsoon has just started and we already have cholera outbreaks in densely populated areas where water and sanitation conditions are very poor.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organization says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.“Monsoon has just begun and we already have several cases of cholera,” Marasini said. “The disease can spread massively in the Capital this year since this is just the beginning of the monsoon season.” Cholera outbreak generally happens after August in Nepal, he added.In October last year, a cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts to curb the infection failed.The current outbreak of cholera is blamed on contaminated water with the increase in rainfall and disruption in garbage collection in Kathmandu Valley. Several other factors including the condition of water supply pipes, water storage, and pollution in water sources affect the quality of water supplied to households, officials said.The Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited still uses the old pipeline laid decades ago in core city areas. Since there are leakages in the old pipelines, there is a high risk of sewage mixing with drinking water. Although the KUKL chlorinates the water before supplying it to households, it is still prone to contamination due to the leaking pipes.Doctors warn that the chances of disease outbreaks not only of cholera but also dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis A, and E, among others, are high due to poor hygiene and contaminated water.Adhikari, the infectious disease expert, said that the authorities' responsibility towards public health does not end with finding the cause of the cholera infection. “The source of the outbreak must be identified and then contained,” he said. “Massive awareness drives should be launched to lessen the risks of infections and for behavioural change in the public.”The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.Apart from all these things, authorities should also start preparation to vaccinate the close circle of the infected people, said Dr Janak Koirala, an infectious disease expert. “Boil water at least for five minutes before drinking,” he advised, “whether it is bottled water or tap water.” ",Three more people infected with cholera in two days .Deadly pathogens might have already spread in several other places of the Capital .Only one in 10 people who get infected with cholera develop severe symptoms such as watery diarrhoea and vomiting .About 80 to 90 percent of infected people might not be aware of the infection and could be unwittingly spreading it to others .,https://kathmandupost.com/health/2022/06/24/7-cholera-cases-in-5-days-raise-alarm,Kathmandu Post,Health ,6/24/2022 7:44
563,Human activities pushing gharials to the brink,"To spot 110 baby gharials—a critically endangered species of crocodile—together in their natural habitat is extremely rare even for seasoned conservationists and nature lovers. But anyone visiting the Dudhauraghat area along the Rapti river that cuts through Chitwan National Park these days could get a glimpse of this awe-inspiring sight wherein a giant female gharial looks after her babies.Dudhauraghat lies around two kilometres south from the elephant breeding centre in Khorsor, Sauraha. The area is nestled amid the quiet of the forests, its peace interrupted only by the occasional chirping of the birds and the sound of the wild animals.Phoebe Griffith, a British researcher who is doing her PhD on gharials, reaches the Dudhauraghat almost every day. She has installed some automated cameras in the area to record the breeding of gharials. The mother gharial hides the babies under water when Griffith goes near their habitat to take out memory cards and exchange batteries in the cameras. The mother gharial gets angry and attempts to attack her sometimes.“It is great to see such a good number of babies of the critically endangered crocodile species,” says Griffith. “But only very few of them grow up as they have to struggle against various challenges of nature.”Studies show that around one percent of the baby gharials bred in the natural habitats survive in India. But no such studies and research are conducted in Nepal. Griffith surmises that around 10 percent of gharials survive in the natural habitats in Nepal.According to conservationists, there are several challenges to raising baby gharials. Some of them are swept away by floods while many others are attacked by some birds and other animals, says Prakash Bahadur Basnet, a resident of Sauraha who has been supporting researchers like Griffith for the past few years.With the start of monsoon, water in Rapti river is gradually turning murky due to floods. And this—monsoon rains that trigger floods—are the main challenge for the baby gharials.“The babies that are grown up in the mother’s care for about eight weeks can face the challenges of nature,” says Griffith. “But the river starts flooding before the baby gharials turn eight weeks.” But this time around, some of them were bred a few weeks ago, so Griffith is optimistic that more baby gharials will make it to adulthood.According to conservationists, gharials are found in some rivers of Nepal, India and Bangladesh, with the Rapti and Narayani rivers being their major natural habitats.The last century has been cataclysmic for the gharials of the world. The gharial population, which was estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000 worldwide during the 1940s, declined by almost 96 percent to below 200 in 1976. This species—the only surviving member of the Gavialidae family—breeds only in the wilds of Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar and Pakistan. It is estimated that the current global gharial population is around 300–900.For Basnet, it’s a cause for some solace that as many gharials have survived amid a flurry of natural and, increasingly, manmade challenges. Gharials are found only in clean flowing water and there should be a bit of sloppy river bank with good quality of sands to lay eggs, says Basnet, adding that the eggs are often destroyed by animals like mongoose.“The mother gharials try their best to protect the babies from big birds, magar crocodiles and fish,” Basnet explains. “But who can save them from the floods in the river? I have been monitoring gharial breeding since 2018. I could find around 10 to 12 gharials that grew up over the time.”The Chitwan National Park established a gharial breeding centre at Kasara in 1978, aiming to conserve the crocodile species by hatching its eggs and releasing them in the rivers when they grow up to two metres in length. The centre has seen some success. There were just 80 gharials in the country before the breeding centre was established.The government authorities conducted nationwide gharial monitoring in 2016. A total of 198 gharials were found during the monitoring. Eighty-four gharials were recovered in the Narayani river, 82 in the Rapti river, 31 in the Babai river and one in the Karnali river.According to Sarojmani Paudel, chief at the gharial breeding centre, a total of 1,692 gharials that grew up in the breeding centre have been released in various rivers as of now. However, the survival rate of those released gharials is not good.The gharial has been enlisted as a protected species in Nepal. Conservationists say amid multiple challenges in gharial conservation, the most worrying are human activities, river pollution and depletion in number of fish.The use of fishing nets that might trap gharials is another challenge in gharial conservation in the country. To counter this, Chitwan National Park has banned the use of fishing nets in the river. Conservationists say there’s some consolation to take from this but it’s not nearly enough to increase the population of this imperiled species. ",110 baby gharials together in their natural habitat is extremely rare even for seasoned conservationists and nature lovers .British researcherPhoebe Griffith has installed some automated cameras in the area to record the breeding of gharials .The mother gharial hides the babies under water when Griffith goes near their habitat to take out memory cards and exchange batteries in the cameras .,https://kathmandupost.com/province-no-3/2022/06/24/human-activities-pushing-gharials-to-the-brink,Kathmandu Post,Bagmati Province ,6/24/2022 9:17
562,Sikta: A project in making for over 15 years with more controversy than progress,"When the Sikta Irrigation project was initiated in the fiscal year 2005-06, it was supposed to be completed by 2014-15, at an estimated cost of Rs12.8 billion.The project in western Nepal was conceptualised with a view to irrigating 33,766 hectares of land west of the Rapti River in Banke district.The project cost was later revised to Rs25 billion by adding a new component so as to irrigate an additional 9,000 hectares to the east of the Rapti River. The project completion deadline was moved to the end of the current fiscal year 2021-22.The extended deadline will expire in less than a month but the project’s progress has been just around 70 percent, according to project officials. “One main canal and one auxiliary canal are near completion, five canals are under construction, but there has been no progress in one canal,” said Krishna Prasad Nepal, deputy director general at the Department of Water Resources and Irrigation.With the project unlikely to be completed within the existing deadline, the Sikta Irrigation Project has prepared a proposal to extend the deadline by another 11 years while doubling the total cost to over Rs50 billion.“We have prepared a proposal to complete the entire project by the fiscal year 2032-33 at an estimated cost between Rs50 billion and Rs53 billion,” said Bishal Yadav, senior divisional engineer at Sikta Irrigation Project. “We will submit the proposal to the Department of Water Resources and Irrigation soon to get approval before the current deadline expires.”He said that certain components have been added in the new proposal so both the cost and time have gone up considerably. “Regular maintenance of headworks and canal structure, upgrading the irrigation system for using underground water if surface water becomes inadequate in the dry season, addition of Tithihiya branch and Thapuwagaun sub-branch under the main canal on the western part of the Rapti River, and addressing the issues of social concerns such as providing lift irrigation and water supply to the local people, are the new components in the proposal,” said Yadav.Like many other national pride projects, Sikta is also facing time and cost overruns for the last several years. Problems related to land acquisition, forest clearance and disputes with contractors are other factors delaying the project of prime importance.The Sikta project has come into the spotlight once again after the Special Court on Sunday acquitted 21 individuals including Bikram Pandey, former minister and the contractor of Sikta’s main canal, of corruption charges. The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, on December 7, 2018, had filed a corruption case against them over alleged substandard construction that led to repeated collapse of the main canal of the multi-billion-rupee national pride project.The main canal was heavily damaged in various places of a 5-km section in June 2016 and July 2018 during the testing process. When the newly built channel was first tested in June 2016, it collapsed in multiple sections. Despite repairs, it broke in July again during another test.The anti-graft body had swung into action after a government probe panel formed in August 2018 submitted a report stating that the main canal was collapsing repeatedly due to the failure to spot loose soil in the designing phase.“After the case was filed against the contractor and officials of Sikta, there was confusion about whether we could repair and maintain the main canal and use the canal for irrigation purposes before the court verdict,” said Nepal, who had also served as the chief of the project. “The cabinet on April 23, 2019 gave its nod to operate an irrigation facility after necessary repair and maintenance.”Based on the cabinet decision, the project started providing irrigation through its main and auxiliary canals on November 16, 2019, according to him. “Repair and maintenance work are being carried out by replacing the loose soil with compact one whenever water in the canal washes away the loose soil,” said Nepal. “There is no permanent solution to the problem.”As per the contract, the Kalika Construction, owned by Pandey, was supposed to do the repair and maintenance work for two years after the completion of the project. But when the canal collapsed the second time, the original deadline given to the contractor to do the repair and maintenance work had already expired and the contract had not been extended. Officials at the project say that although the main canal is currently supplying water to some farmlands, they are not certain whether the sections constructed on loose soil will be able to sustain the pressure when the project is run in full capacity after its completion. The corruption case alone is not responsible for the delay in the national pride project, but the ongoing arbitration with Pappu Construction, a sub-contractor that built a part of the project, has also affected its progress.In July 2016, Coastal-Pappu JV was awarded the contract to construct main and link canals and rehabilitation of headworks of Dunduwa Irrigation System, one of the main branches of the project, for Rs980 million.After it turned out that the progress on the work handled by Coastal-Pappu JV was just around seven percent by October 2018, the deadline given for the work, the project office in November 2018 had terminated the contract with the company. Pappu, which is infamous for delaying projects, went for arbitration proceedings, which are still ongoing. “Because of the ongoing arbitration process, we have not been able to issue a fresh tender notice to implement this section of the project,” said Yadav. “As it has already been four years since the contract was terminated with Pappu, the cost of the new contract will be more than Rs2 billion.”The Dunduwa Irrigation System project would irrigate 16,000 hectare lands in western Banke district. This area is more than one-third of the total 44,000 hectares that Sikta Project would irrigate.The Sikta project stands as a classic example of how Nepal’s infrastructure projects never get completed on time. Since the two decade-old project was started, millions of cusecs of water must have flown in the Rapti river, with the beneficiaries merely becoming spectators.Although the Special Court gave a clean chit to those accused of corruption, a task force formed to investigate the repeated collapse of the main canal had stated that consultants, while designing the project, failed to carry out a special test of the soil, which led to the construction of a fragile canal.“The detailed project report prepared by the consultant says nothing about the presence of loose soil in the area where the canal collapsed,” Sushil Chandra Tiwari, the chief of the task force, had told the Post in October 2018.Although the project office has been replacing loose soil with compact soil in the problem sections of the main canal, it has still not been able to find a permanent solution to the recurring problem. “Until now, the solution appears to be to continue replacing the loose soil with compact one,” said Yadav. “Whether the government itself will do this or the contractor will, is not clear yet as we have yet to receive the verdict of the Special Court.” ","The Sikta Irrigation project in western Nepal was conceptualised with a view to irrigating 33,766 hectares of land west of the Rapti River in Banke district .The project completion deadline was moved to the end of the current fiscal year 2021-22 .The extended deadline will expire in less than a month but the project’s progress has been just around 70 percent .The Sikta Irrigation Project has prepared a proposal to extend the deadline by another 11 years while doubling the total cost to over Rs50 billion .",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/06/24/sikta-a-project-in-making-for-over-15-years-with-more-controversy-than-progress,Kathmandu Post,National ,6/24/2022 7:53
561,Chobhar dry port attracts few traders,"Chobhar dry port launched in April with much hoopla, but the modern facility has attracted few traders. Officials say less than two dozen container trucks have arrived here since it opened.Built at the south-western edge of Kathmandu Valley at a cost of Rs1.54 billion, the Inland Clearance Depot offers customs clearance services, saving importers a trip to the border checkpoint to clear their cargo.Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba inaugurated the infrastructure, which is spread over 11.77 hectares.“Traders say that without an expressway linking it to the border, transporting goods to Chobhar dry port is a hassle,” said Ashish Gajurel, executive director of the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board which operates the inland depot. According to traders, travel time would be shortened if there was a Kathmandu-Tarai expressway. The dry port offers 35,000 square feet of parking space which is large enough to accommodate 500 containers and 500 trucks. There are three buildings containing customs offices, quarantine facility and security, three warehouses, storage shed, three weighing machines, electric sub-station and boundary lights.""Traders have been opening letters of credit (LC) to import goods that will enter the country through Bhairahawa, Biratnagar and Birgunj. Since it normally takes three months for the shipments to arrive after the LC is opened, maybe Chobhar dry port will see more activity then,"" Gajurel said. “It may take a few months for the dry port to get into full swing,” he said.Officials say that customs agents are not keen to clear their shipments at Chobhar dry port even though it is cheaper than at the border checkpoints.“It is cheaper to clear goods at Chobhar dry port compared to Birgunj. Since there is little traffic at the new facility, paperwork moves faster than at Birgunj or Biratnagar dry ports. The parking fees are lower too,” Gajurel said. The fee for weighing goods is half of what is charged at Birgunj Integrated Check Post, and the container handling charge is 20 percent lower, according to a port official. “We have been repeatedly communicating with the private sector and traders highlighting the features of Chobhar dry port. But there is not much interest so far,” Gajurel said.""The private sector was enthusiastic when construction work began. Now, they are not responding,"" Gajurel said.“New infrastructure should be marketed well. This applies to Chobhar dry port too,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, director general of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries. “We don’t see any marketing approach informing potential traders about the new facility,” he said.Nepal's second international airport after Kathmandu, which opened in the southern city of Bhairahawa on May 16, seems to have the same problem, insiders said. Gautam Buddha International Airport has been able to attract only one foreign airline so far. Jazeera Airways flies thrice a week to Kuwait.Joshi said that to attract operators, new facilities should launch schemes by offering incentives.“This marketing strategy is applicable to all new facilities around the world. A country like Nepal needs modern infrastructure, but it also needs smart efforts to make them operational in an effective way,"" Joshi said.""The proposed Kathmandu-Tarai expressway will definitely add relevance to the port in the coming years,"" he said. Around 70 percent of all imported goods that enter Nepal are consumed in Kathmandu Valley, and planners thought a dry port here would make life easier for traders.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported goods worth Rs1.76 trillion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year ended mid-June, up 28 percent year-on-year. Exports in the same period were valued at Rs185.83 billion.Nepal’s total foreign trade reached Rs1.94 trillion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up 30 percent year-on-year. The value of the total foreign trade in the last fiscal year 2020-21 was Rs1.68 trillion.The Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board, a government agency, is currently running the depot, but the facility will be handed over to the private sector through a competitive bidding process, according to officials.The then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli laid the foundation stone for Chobhar dry port on January 18, 2019. It was built with a loan from the World Bank, and construction work was completed last June.

560,10 Unified Socialist lawmakers submit memorandum demanding Parliamentary Party meeting,"As many as 10 CPN (Unified Socialist) lawmakers registered a memorandum at the party headquarters on Friday expressing displeasure over the party’s decision to change the ministers.In the first week of June, the party had decided to recall four ministers but that decision has not been implemented yet.Ten lawmakers, including four ministers from the party, have demanded an immediate meeting of the Parliamentary Party, saying the party has made an immature decision changing the ministers.“We have registered a memorandum at party headquarters to discuss the party’s decision to recall the ministers,” Health Minister Birodh Khatiwada told the Post.Along with Khatiwada, Urban Development Minister Ram Kumari Jhakri, Labor Minister Kisan Shrestha, Tourism Minister Prem Ale and lawmakers Krishnalal Maharjan, Nirudevai Jairu, Dhan Bahadur Budha, Pushpa Kumari Karna Kayastha, Binadevi Budhathoki and Gopal Bahadur Bam have signed the memorandum.

557,Nepali migrant workers find themselves entangled in Poland’s red tape,"When Samir Pradhan (name changed) landed in Poland about a year ago, he was over the moon. He was in Europe. The high-rise buildings, bustling malls and smooth flow of traffic on the roads were mesmerising. He thought he had come to the right place. He also had a job in a meat-packing factory.But as the days passed, a harsher reality began to sink in. “Poland isn’t what you would expect it to be,” said the 35-year-old over the phone. “The money I make here is just enough to buy things I need. It’s difficult to save up and send money home.” He shares a room in the accommodation that the meat-packing company has provided with four others. “That’s not comfortable,” said Pradhan.Stories of low wages, squalid living conditions and exploitation at every step of the way—from recruitment to poor pay—are all too common for Nepali workers in Eastern Europe, as reported by the Post earlier. Getting wages enough to pay off the money borrowed to pay recruiters back in Nepal and to send money for families is not the only problem Nepali migrants face in this country of 37.8 million known for its harsh winters.Nepalis pay agents anywhere between Rs500,000 and Rs1.3 million to get to Poland. Often these transactions are carried out informally without receipts issued, making it difficult to prove fraud in case anyone gets duped. And once they get to the country, it often turns out that the earnings are much lower than promised—for example, PLN (Polish zloty) 2,000 (equivalent to approximately Rs60,000) instead of the same amount in euros (equivalent to approximately Rs 275,800) which Nepali migrant workers had often been told to expect by recruiters back home.Poland is a relatively new labour destination for Nepalis. According to the Polish Office for Foreigners, only 95 Nepalis lived in the country with a residence permit in 2007. In 2018, the number reached 1,150 and crossed the 3,000 mark in 2020. But these figures don’t include a sizeable number of Nepalis who come to Poland on non-work visas which can be as long as year-long. Members of the Nepali community estimate that as many as 5,000 Nepalis live in Poland.For the Nepali migrant workers, Poland poses an additional challenge—one that turns people like Pradhan into ‘slaves of documents’. Before Poland issues a visa to foreign workers, they need to get a work permit, meaning that a job has to be waiting for them in the country. Poland has been issuing work permits to foreigners in large numbers in recent years. The year 2018 saw a 40 percent increase in the number of work permits issued compared to the previous year. In the first half of 2019, it issued 233,000 permits, a 66 percent increment compared to the same period the previous year. While Ukrainians represent the vast majority of work permit recipients, with 72 percent of the total in 2018, the second highest number of work permits was issued to Nepalis—22,336 in 2018 (6 percent of the total work permits issued that year).But not all those who have permission to work in Poland get to the country. Every year a large number of Nepalis are refused visas even if they have been issued their work permits. According to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 2019, around 75 percent of applications of Nepalis were rejected. The most common reasons for refusals are: lack of confirmation of the purpose of the stay, concealment of the truth, forging documents or suspicion that the foreigner will leave the territory of Poland before the expiry of the visa.According to a report, Shifting Labor Frontiers: The Recruitment of South Asian Migrant Workers to the European Union (2020), “The issuing of work permits is only the beginning of the recruitment process – it does not guarantee that the migrant worker will actually use the work permit issued and occupy the job he or she has been recruited for. The work permit only indicates that the Polish company entrusts the execution of work to a particular worker, as well as the type of work to be performed.”The study found that even if most employers want to hire workers immediately, it can take up to 18 months before a migrant worker can fill the position s/he has been recruited for. Some of them arrive in Poland with their working permits about to expire—sometimes it turns out when they get to Poland they are not needed anymore. Then there is another problem workers face once they get to Poland and want to change jobs. A new job means a new work permit. And this can take months. “It can’t continue to be like this. We are slaves of documents!” says Mitra Lal Parday, who moved to Poland in 2007 as a student, but gave up his studies to work at a restaurant.After eight years of working in a restaurant, he started his own business. “If they tell us to go back, we'll go back. But they can’t tell us to do that as Poland needs workers,” he adds. “So why can’t they issue permits on time?” Meanwhile, Pradhan is considering changing his job. “I don’t know how the system works. They say that we need to wait for months before our permit is renewed and we are allowed to change jobs,” he said. One of his friends has been visiting the government office concerned for months to renew his permit, without much luck. Under Polish law, a worker requires the sponsorship of an employer to apply for a work permit. If workers want to change jobs but can’t find a new employer, they have to either work illegally without a permit or return to Nepal.Polish government offices have their own reasons for the delay in issuing permits. Some administrative activities are still performed manually: for example, after the application is submitted personally by the foreigner, an official has to enter the content of the document into the system. And, that takes time.Before the pandemic, the Polish government had decided to digitise the whole system to ensure better flow of information between individual offices and enable online submission of applications. But digitisation has been slow—information is still exchanged offline between voivodeship (the highest administrative division in Poland equivalent to province in other countries) offices, labour offices and opinion-giving bodies. Besides, a system that would provide immediate and secure access to all data does not yet exist.A study by the Supreme Audit Office, the top independent state audit authority, which checked in 2019 whether the public administration is prepared for the efficient service to foreigners, stated that “too few officials and insufficient financial resources have a decisive influence on the prolongation of administrative proceedings”.The study also found that public authorities and individual offices do not provide foreigners with reliable information. Parday, who has had to visit the Mazowiecki office, the vivodeship in the Warsaw region, several times to renew his permit, says the officials have only one thing to say: “Go online!” “That’s not the only thing that makes applying for work permits difficult. The list of documents required for the application process is in Polish, which many Nepalis can’t decipher,” he said. Foreigners, including Nepalis, do not know where to find detailed information about their situations like having overstayed their visas or their work permit expiring and turn to intermediaries—some of whom are frauds. Although the system of employing foreigners in Poland looks decent on paper, it actually enslaves migrants, because if a person wants to change jobs, it is not so easy, says Cezary Bachański, president of the employment agency Inter-Factor Polska. As a result, some Nepalis end up working without a permit, although if an offence is found, they may be deported with a ban on entering the country for a specified period of time. A Nepali migrant worker at one of the many Nepali restaurants in Warsaw wondered if he had a choice. “I worked ‘black’ for a year myself. Because it took so long with the appeals [for a work permit],” said the Nepali worker, who did not want his identity to be revealed. “Meanwhile, the family has to be sustained.”According to Bachański, there is no political will to simplify the rules. After all, foreigners can’t vote. And entrepreneurs’ voices are not easily heard despite them being short of workers. Witold Klaus, professor at the Center for Research on Migration Law of the Institute of Legal Sciences of the Polish Academy of Sciences, also has doubts that laws will be simplified soon. “On the one hand, we need economic migrants, and on the other hand, we are doing nothing to facilitate their arrival and access to the necessary permits,” he said. “The attitude is: ‘It is probably not that bad if they come here. Let them fight if they want’.”But back in Nepal, recruiting agencies do not accept that there are issues for Nepali workers once they get to Poland. “Once the worker has received a work permit, there is no way that they won’t get the job. European countries have better laws for migrant workers than Gulf countries and ensure workers’ freedom of mobility,” said Sujeet Kumar Shrestha, general secretary of Nepal Association of Foreign Employment Agencies (NAFEA), a grouping of recruiting agencies hiring and supplying Nepali workers to foreign employers. Shrestha even claimed that an employer’s permission is not required to change jobs despite the ground reality in Poland being different. He said that recruitment agencies would not be in a position to dupe migrant workers. “As per Nepal’s foreign employment rules, recruiting agencies have to be responsible for anything that a worker faces while working abroad,” he said. Nepal government officials, on the other hand, say Nepalis are facing issues in emerging labour destinations such as Poland, Croatia, Romania and Malta in Europe because of malpractices during recruitment.According to Kumar Prasad Dahal, director general at the Department of Foreign Employment, despite the growing demand for workers in those countries, aspirant workers have to make their own arrangements to get to countries like Poland as there are no Nepali missions as in the case of Malaysia and Gulf countries to attest demand. And the recruitment agencies, without enough information, are duping Nepali migrants, he said. “Companies in Poland, recruiting agencies in Nepal and individual agents hardly have any connections between them,” Dahal said. “Nepali recruiting agencies can not reach out to Polish employers, except some email communication. Even artificial demands are created for supplying workers to fake companies through individual contacts. For such jobs, workers are charged a hefty amount but when they reach there are no such companies.” The solution is a formal deal between Nepal and countries like Poland, officials and experts say. “Once we have a formal deal, for which many European countries are eager too, and Nepali missions in those countries, we can eliminate recruitment malpractices through verification of demands,” said Dahal. “We can capture the growing demand for Nepali workers and also solve any issues faced by them through formal negotiations.” It was in 2018 that a task force suggested some kind of formal agreement with Poland as one of the new labour destinations. The government had also started some negotiations for signing such deals with some European countries, but not much has happened. “Nepali workers have been investing nearly Rs1 million to pursue their European dreams. But the dreams don’t always materialise,” said Rameshwar Nepal, a member of the 2018 task force. “If a Nepali mission was there then at least their hassles could be resolved quickly.” “Besides, a deal with one country can have a multiplier effect like better protection for Nepali migrants workers and their rights and also tapping the demand coming from European countries like Poland, which is an attractive labour destination comparatively.” This story was produced under a grant from Journalismfund.eu and Hostwriter.","Stories of low wages, squalid living conditions and exploitation are all too common for Nepali workers in Eastern Europe .Getting wages enough to pay off the money borrowed to pay recruiters back in Nepal is not the only problem Nepali migrants face .Nepalis pay agents anywhere between Rs500,000 and Rs1.3 million to get to Poland .",https://kathmandupost.com/national/2021/04/10/nepali-migrant-workers-find-themselves-entangled-in-poland-s-red-tape,Kathmandu Post,National,4/13/2021 10:31
555,How hiking is making tremendous strides,"Bhagirathi Karki runs a small eatery near Shivapuri National Park. She is pleasantly surprised by the increased footfall in her shop lately.“I am earning in two weeks what I used to make in about a month earlier,” Karki said. “Ever since the pandemic eased and restrictions were lifted, my business has picked up.”Her new customers are those who come for hiking in the morning hours in the national park.Shivapuri National Park, located in the northern rim of Kathmandu, has emerged as a popular hiking destination for Kathmandu residents of late.As the pandemic-induced curbs led to closure of public places, including gyms, those trying to stay fit found solace in trails around Kathmandu Valley. Hiking became a new fad for not just fitness enthusiasts but also those who sought some time in peace or those who wanted to spend time with friends and families outdoors.Antim Rokaya and Preeti Kafle, both in their mid-20s, say the city’s hubbub, claustrophobic clutter, and need for fresh air drove them into taking up hiking. “I find hiking a better way to spend our free time,” said Kafle. “There is no escaping the urban landscape in Kathmandu except when you hit a trail.”In the last two years, popular hiking trails—Shivapuri National Park, Amitabha Monastery, Kakani, Phulchowki, Nagarkot, Sundarijal, Champadevi, and Chisapani, among others—in and around the Valley have seen an increase in the footfall of hikers making their way into the wild.Most of the Covid restrictions have now been lifted but the threat of another wave of the pandemic lingers in the air with various states in the neighbouring India reporting a new surge in cases. “In such a scenario, it would be unwise to resume physical contact with people. It feels uncomfortable,” said Rokaya. “So the only other option to be out in the open is to go on a hike.”Kathmandu, the capital and most populated city of the country, offers the best amenities—be it cinemas, pubs, bars, or gymnasiums, apart from schools and colleges. But the city is one of the most polluted in the world, with experts on many occasions warning against jogging within the city area in the morning.Experts say the air quality around the trails covered with greenery is far better than in the city area.Archana Shrestha, a schoolteacher and a regular hiker, says she used to go hiking in the Shivapuri National Park area and along the Sundarijal trail earlier too. But she turned into a regular hiker after the pandemic. Shivapuri National Park covers an area of 118 square kilometres, and over the years it has become a major hiking destination for locals and tourists alike.“I go on a hike to get away from the city’s noise. Hiking is an escape for me,” said the 24-year-old. “Two years ago, I would not come across a single person on the Shivapuri hiking trail but these days I encounter dozens.”According to data from the Shivapuri National Park, nearly 2,000 tourists visit the park during weekends. “Most of them come to hike. The number of hikers has gone up in the last few years,” said Manjit Bista, a ranger at the park.An activity of moderate difficulty, hiking is making such tremendous strides that just about everyone seems to be climbing the small trails around the Valley.Romkanta Pokhrel, in his late 40s, says he has covered almost all the hiking trails in and around Kathmandu Valley.“Since the pandemic, several people in my circle have approached me asking about hiking trails,” Pokhrel, a PhD scholar and a teacher, told the Post. “Hiking is a good fitness activity but it’s equally good for the mind as well. Hiking takes us closer to nature.”Nepal has always been famous for trekking activities. Thousands of tourists visit the country every year for mountain treks, with the most popular being the Annapurna Base Camp. Such mountain treks, however, last weeks and need good preparation.But hiking is about walking up small trails for a couple of hours, hikers say.According to Prakash KC, a physical trainer and nutrition consultant, hiking is good for health in many ways, especially for people who don’t want to lift heavy weights or who do not like gym workouts.“Walking for a couple of hours boosts stamina and conditions the muscles,” said KC. Doctors, however, say while hiking may have its own health benefits, one needs to pay attention to certain aspects of it before undertaking the activity and that people should not just hit the trails because everyone is doing so.According to Dr Rakesh Shrestha, a physiotherapist at the Annapurna Neuro Hospital, people with medical conditions should consult their physicians before going on a hike.“Since it involves walking up the trails, some might suffer from altitude sickness or have difficulty in breathing,” said Shrestha. “If a person has no health issues and the body can adapt quickly to the new environment, one can go for it because it can bring tremendous health benefits.”He said that he has encountered some incidents where people have collapsed while hiking. “There are pros and cons to everything,” he added.While the health aspect as suggested by doctors is one issue about hiking, the increased footfall around the Valley’s trails has created yet another problem.Pokhrel, the avid hiker, says during his recent hike to the Amitabh Monastery trail, northwest of Swayambhu, he was shocked to see the garbage strewn around the trail.Officials at the Shivapuri National Park also say with the increase in the number of hikers, the trails are getting littered with plastic bottles and food wrappers.“Although we have very strict rules about waste disposal inside the park area with penalties in place for irresponsible hikers, we still come across plastic bottles, wrappers, masks and waste paper littered inside the park,” said Bista, the park ranger.Laxman Poudel, chief conservation officer at the park, said irresponsible garbage disposal inside the national park is also putting the wildlife in danger.“A few months ago, I found beer bottles, tin cans, cigarette butts and plastic waste in the national park. If the animals in the conservation area consume such waste, it could be lethal for them,” said Poudel.“Most of the hikers who come here are youths and they usually come in groups. They carry their own food and snacks, and even though they should take their waste back with them, most don’t.”","Shivapuri National Park, located in the northern rim of Kathmandu, has emerged as a popular hiking destination .Hiking became a new fad for not just fitness enthusiasts but also those who sought some time in peace .Kathmandu, the capital and most populated city of the country, offers the best amenities—be it cinemas, pubs, bars, or gymnasiums, apart from schools and colleges .",https://kathmandupost.com/travel/2022/05/06/how-hiking-is-making-tremendous-strides,Kathmandu Post,Travel,5/6/2022 7:58
